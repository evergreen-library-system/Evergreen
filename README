README for Evergreen 1.4

Installing prerequisites:
========================
Evergreen has a number of prerequisite packages that must be installed
before you can successfully configure, compile, and install Evergreen.

1. Begin by installing the most recent version of OpenSRF (1.0 or later).
You can download OpenSRF 1.0.2 from
http://evergreen-ils.org/downloads/OpenSRF-1.0.2.tar.gz

2. On Debian and Ubuntu, the easiest way to install the rest of the
prerequisites for Evergreen is to use the Makefile.install prerequisite
installer.

Issue the following commands as the root user to install prerequisites
using the Makefile.install prerequisite installer, substituting
"debian-etch", "debian-lenny", "ubuntu-hardy", or "ubuntu-intrepid"
as matches your Linux distribution version for <osname> below:

make -f Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install <osname>

Note: You may also be able to use "centos" to install the Evergreen 
prerequisites for CentOS 5 and RHEL 5, or "gentoo" for Gentoo - but
these are less tested distributions. Your patches and suggestions for
improvement are welcome!

Configuration and compilation instructions:
==========================================

For the time being, we are still installing everything in the /openils/
directory (with the exception of the Perl modules, which are installed
into system directories). Issue the following commands to configure and
build Evergreen:

./configure --prefix=/openils --sysconfdir=/openils/conf
make

Installation instructions:
=========================

Once you have configured and compiled Evergreen, issue the following
command as the root user to install Evergreen:

make STAFF_CLIENT_BUILD_ID=rel_1_4_0_0 install

This will install Evergreen, including example configuration files in
/openils/conf/ that you can use as templates for your own configuration files.
The STAFF_CLIENT_BUILD_ID variable stamps the server-side and client-side files
for the staff client to ensure that they match.

Change ownership of the Evergreen files:
=======================================

All files in the /openils/ directory and subdirectories must be owned by the
"opensrf" user. Issue the following command as the root user to change the
ownership on the files:

chown -R opensrf:opensrf /openils

Configure the Apache Web server:
===============================

Use the example configuration files in Open-ILS/examples/apache/ to configure
your Web server for the Evergreen catalog, staff client, Web services, and
administration interfaces.

Configure OpenSRF for the Evergreen application:
===============================================

There are a number of example OpenSRF configuration files in /openils/conf/ that
you can use as a template for your Evergreen installation.

cp /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml.example /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml
cp /openils/conf/opensrf.xml.example /openils/conf/opensrf.xml

When you installed OpenSRF, you will have created four Jabber users on two
separate domains and edited the opensrf_core.xml file accordingly. Please
refer back to the OpenSRF README and edit the Evergreen version of the
opensrf_core.xml file using the same Jabber users and domains as you used
while installing and testing OpenSRF.

eg_db_config.pl, described in the following section, will set the database
connection information in opensrf.xml for you.

Creating the Evergreen database:
===============================

PostgreSQL 8.2 will be installed on your system by the Makefile.install
prerequisite installer if packages are available for your distribution, or
you will have to compile PostgreSQL 8.2 from source and install it (which
is beyond the scope of this document).

Once the PostgreSQL 8.2 database server has been installed, you will need to
create the database and add the appropriate languages and extensions to
support Evergreen. Issue the following commands as the "postgres" user to set
up a database called "evergreen". Note that the location of the PostgreSQL
"contrib" packages may vary depending on your distribution:

createdb -E UNICODE evergreen
createlang plperl evergreen
createlang plperlu evergreen
createlang plpgsql evergreen
psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.2/contrib/tablefunc.sql -d evergreen
psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.2/contrib/tsearch2.sql -d evergreen
psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.2/contrib/pgxml.sql -d evergreen

Once you have created the Evergreen database, you need to create a PostgreSQL
user to access the database. Issue the following command as the "postgres"
user to create a new PostgreSQL user named "evergreen". When prompted, enter
the new user's password and answer "yes" to make the new role a superuser:

createuser -P evergreen

Once you have created the Evergreen database, you also need to create the
database schema and configure your configuration files to point at the
database server. Issue the following command as root from inside the Evergreen
source directory, replacing <user>, <password>, <hostname>, <port>, and <dbname>
with the appropriate values for your PostgreSQL database:

perl Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/eg_db_config.pl --update-config \
       --service all --create-schema --create-bootstrap --create-offline \
       --user <user> --password <password> --hostname <hostname> --port <port> \
       --database <dbname>

This will create the database schema and configure all of the services in
your /openils/conf/opensrf.xml configuration file to point to that database.
It also creates the configuration files required by the Evergreen cgi-bin
administration scripts.
