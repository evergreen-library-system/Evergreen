[TIP]
On check-in, Evergreen will prompt staff to re-route the item to cataloging.

Due Dates
^^^^^^^^^

Circulation periods are pre-set. When items are checked out, due dates are automatically calculated and inserted into circulation records if the *Specific Due Date* checkbox is not selected on the Check Out screen. The *Specific Due Date* checkbox allows you to set a different due date to override the pre-set loan period.

Before you scan the item, select the *Specific Due Date* checkbox. Use the calendar widget to select a date. Or click in day, month or year, then use the up or down arrows to make the change or simply delete the data, then enter again. Time is used for hourly loan only. This date applies to all items until you change the date, de-select the *Specific Due Date* checkbox, or quit the patron record.

Renewal and Editing the Item's Due Date

Marking Items Lost and Claimed Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lost Items
^^^^^^^^^^
1) To mark items Lost, retrieve patron record and click *Items Out*.

image::media/lost_cr_section.png[]

4) The lost item also adds to the count of *Lost* items in the patron summary on the left (or top) of the screen. 

image::media/patron_summary_checkouts.jpg[]

[NOTE]
Lost Item Billing
========================
- Marking an item Lost will automatically bill the patron the replacement cost of the item as recorded in the price field in the item record, and a processing fee as determined by your local policy. If the lost item has overdue charges, the overdue charges may be voided or retained based on local policy.
- A lost-then-returned item will disappear from the Items Out screen only when all bills linked to this particular circulation have been resolved. Bills may include replacement charges, processing fees, and manual charges added to the existing bills. 
- The replacement fee and processing fee for lost-then-returned items may be voided if set by local policy. Overdue fines may be reinstated on lost-then-returned items if set by local policy.
==========================

Refunds for Lost Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an item is returned after a lost bill has been paid and the library's policy is to void the replacement fee for lost-then-returned items, there will be a negative balance in the bill. A refund needs to be made to close the bill and the circulation record. Once the outstanding amount has been refunded, the bill and circulation record will be closed and the item will disappear from the Items Out screen.

If you need to balance a bill with a negative amount and close the linked lost circulation record without making a refund (removing the item from the *Lost, Claimed Returned, Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Bills* panel on the *Items Out* screen), you need to add two dummy bills to the existing bills. The first one can be of any amount (e.g. $0.01), while the second should be of the absolute value of the negative amount. Then you need to void the first dummy bill. The reason for using a dummy bill is that Evergreen will check and close the circulation record only when payment is applied or bills are voided.

Claimed Returned Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) To mark an item Claimed Returned, retrieve the patron record and go to the *Items Out* screen.

2) Select the item, then select *Actions for Selected Items* -> *Mark Claimed Returned* from the dropdown menu.

4) The Claimed Returned item now displays in the *Lost/Claimed Returned/Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Billings* section of the patron record.

image::media/lost_cr_section.png[]

5) The Claimed Returned item adds to the count of Check Outs that are Claimed Returned in the patron summary on the left (or top) of the screen. It also adds to the total *Claims-returned Count* (including those that are current Check Outs and those that have since been returned) that is displayed when editing the patron's record. 

image::media/patron_summary_checkouts.jpg[]

[NOTE]
More on Claimed Returned Items
====================================
- The date entered for a Claimed Returned item establishes the fine. If the date given has passed, bills will be adjusted accordingly.
- When a Claimed Returned item is returned, if there is an outstanding bill associated with it, the item will not disappear from the *Items Out* screen. It will disappear when the outstanding bills are resolved.
- When an item is marked Claimed Returned, the value in *Claims-returned Count* field in the patron record is automatically increased. Staff can manually adjust this count by editing the patron record.
====================================

Upload From File allows you to load multiple items saved in a file on your local computer. The file contains a list of the barcodes in text format. To ensure smooth uploading and further processing on the items, it is recommended that the list contains no more than 100 items.
