Styling the searchbar on the homepage
-------------------------------------

The `.searchbar-home` class is added to the div that
contains the searchbar when on the homepage.  This allows
sites to customize the searchbar differently on the
homepage than in search results pages, and other places the
search bar appears.  For example, adding the following CSS
would create a large, Google-style search bar on the homepage only:

[source,css]
----
.searchbar-home .search-box {
  width: 80%;
  height: 3em;
}

.searchbar-home #search_qtype_label,
.searchbar-home #search_itype_label,
.searchbar-home #search_locg_label {
  display:none;
}
