Describing your organization
============================

Your Evergreen system is almost ready to go. You'll need to add each of the
libraries that will be using your Evergreen system. If you're doing this for a
consortium, you'll have to add your consortium as a whole, and all the
libraries and branches that are members of the consortium. In this chapter,
we'll talk about how to get the Evergreen system to see all your libraries, how
to set each one up, and how to edit all the details of each one. 

Organization Unit Types 
-----------------------
The term _Organization Unit Types_ refers to levels in the hierarchy of your
library system(s). Examples could include: All-Encompassing Consortium, Library
System, Branch, Bookmobile, Sub-Branch, etc. 

You can add or remove organizational unit types, and rename them as needed to
match the organizational hierarchy that matches the libraries using your
installation of Evergreen. Organizational unit types should never have proper
names since they are only generic types. 

When working with configuration, settings, and permissions, it is very
important to be careful of the Organization Unit *Context Location* - this is the
organizational unit to which the configuration settings are being applied. If,
for example, a setting is applied at the Consortium context location, all child
units will inherit that setting. If a specific branch location is selected,
only that branch and its child units will have the setting applied. The levels
of the hierarchy to which settings can be applied are often referred to in
terms of "depth" in various configuration interfaces. In a typical hierarchy,
the consortium has a depth of 0, the system is 1, the branch is 2, and any
bookmobiles or sub-branches is 3.

Create and edit Organization Unit Types 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Open *Admin > Server Administration > Organization Types*.
. In the left panel, expand the *Organization Unit Types* hierarchy. 
. Click on a organization type to edit the existing type or to add a new
  organization unit. 
. A form opens in the right panel, displaying the data for the selected
  organization unit. 
. Edit the fields as required and click *Save*. 

To create a new dependent organization unit, click *New Child*. The new child
organization unit will appear in the left panel list below the parent.
Highlight the new unit and edit the data as needed, click *Save*

Organizational Units 
--------------------
'Organizational Units' are the specific instances of the organization unit types
that make up your library's hierarchy. These will have distinctive proper names
such as Main Street Branch or Townsville Campus. 

Remove or edit default Organizational Units 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installing the Evergreen software, the default CONS, SYS1, BR1, etc.,
organizational units remain. These must be removed or edited to reflect actual
library entities. 

Create and edit Organizational Units 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Open *Admin > Server Administration > Organizational Units*.
. In the left panel, expand the the Organizational Units hierarchy, select a
  unit.
. A form opens in the right panel, displaying the data for the selected
  organizational unit.
. To edit the existing, default organizational unit, enter system or library
  specific data in the form; complete all three tabs: Main Settings, Hours
  of Operation, Addresses.
. Click *Save*.

To create a new dependent organizational unit, click *New Child*. The new child
will appear in the hierarchy list below the parent unit. Click on the new unit
and edit the data, click *Save*

Organizational Unit data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *Addresses* tab allows you to enter library contact information. Library
Phone number, email address, and addresses are used in patron email
notifications, hold slips, and transit slips. The Library address tab is broken
out into four address types: Physical Address, Holds Address, Mailing Address,
ILL Address. 

The *Hours of Operation* tab is where you enter regular, weekly hours. Holiday
and other closures are set in the *Closed Dates Editor*. Hours of operation and
closed dates impact due dates and fine accrual.  

Set closed dates using the Closed Dates Editor 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Open *Admin > Local Administration > Closed Dates Editor*.
. Select type of closure: typically Single Day or Multiple Day.
. Click the Calendar gadget to select the All Day date or starting and ending
  dates.
. Enter a Reason for closure (optional).
. Click *Apply* to all of my libraries if your organizational unit has children
  units that will also be closed.
. Click *Save*.

Now that your organizational structure is established, you can begin
configuring permissions for the staff users of your Evergreen system.
