.Use case
****
Users often miss the list of parts on the Place Holds screen, leading to
many title-level holds on records where only one or two libraries may have
unparted copies. This setting can make the part selection process more
visible to patrons placing holds.
****

An alternate display option is available on the place holds screen.  In the
alternate view, patrons select parts via radio buttons instead of the traditional
dropdown menu. This display increases the visibility of parts on the Place Holds
screen and also forces users to make an explicit choice.
To enable the alternate display, set the `enable.radio.parts` option to true in config.tt2.
