Acquisitions::
  Processes related to ordering materials and managing expenditures.
Age Protection:: 
  Allows libraries to prevent holds on new books (on a item by item basis) from outside the owning library's branch or system for a designated amount of time.

  Records used to control the contents of MARC fields.
[[B]]Balance stop percent::
  A setting in acquisitions that prevents you from making purchases when only a specified amount of the fund remains. 
Barcode::
  The code/number attached to the item.  This is not the database ID. Barcodes are added to items to facilitate the checking in and out of an item. Barcodes can be changed as needed. Physical barcodes that can be placed on items can follow several different barcode symboligies.

  Processes relating to reserving cataloged and non- bibliographic items.
Brick::
  A brick is a unit consisting of one or more servers. It refers to a set of servers with ejabberd, Apache, and all applicable Evergreen services.  It is possible to run all the software on a single server, creating a “single server brick.” Typically, larger installations will have more than one such brick and, hence, be more robust.
