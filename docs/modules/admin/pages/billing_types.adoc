== Introduction ==
_Billing Types_ is an administrative interface that manages the different types of bills the user can apply to patron accounts.  Some of these are system generated and some are bills you can manually apply.

To access the interface, go to _Administration_ -> _Server Administration_ -> _Billing Types_.

[NOTE]
Setting a _Default Price_ will automatically apply the said price whenever that billing is added to the patron account.  This can be handy for replacement barcodes, processing fees, etc.
