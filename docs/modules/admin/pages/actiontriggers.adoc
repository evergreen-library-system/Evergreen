indexterm:[action triggers, event definitions, notifications]

Action Triggers allow administrators to set up actions for specific events,
useful for notifications such as hold notifications.

=== Accessing the Notifications / Action Triggers Module ===

Access the Notifications / Action Triggers from the top menu bar in the staff client
by navigating to *Administration* -> *Local Administration* ->
*Notifications / Action triggers*.

[NOTE]
====
You must have Local Administrator permissions to access the Notifications /
Action Triggers Module.
====

== Main Parts of Action Triggers ==

Action triggers are composed of four main components: Event Definitions,
Hooks, Reactors, and Validators.

.Table of Main Parts of Action Triggers
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Part*            | *Description*
| Event Definitions | Define the events and conditions that initiate actions.
| Hooks             | Specify the Fieldmapper class and link to the IDL class.
| Reactors          | Connect triggers to the actions to be executed.
| Validators        | Establish validation tests to determine if actions should be executed.
|===

Each of these components has a corresponding tab in the Notifications /
Action Triggers module.
Selecting a tab displays a grid of relevant data with options to add, edit,
or delete entries.

.Action Trigger Module Tabs
image::actiontriggers/tabs.png[Action Trigger Module Tabs, width=450]

=== Event Definitions ===

Event Definitions is the main tab and contains the key fields when working
with action triggers.
An event definition is a set of fields that will be returned to the
validators and/or reactors for processing.
Normally, when you create a new action trigger, you will start here.
Evergreen comes with a set of predefined hooks, validators, and reactors
that can be used to create new action triggers.

[[_event_definition_fields]]
.Event Definition Fields
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Field*                         | *Description*
| Owning Library                 | The shortname of the library for which the action / trigger / hook is defined.
| Name                           | The name of the trigger event, that links to a trigger event environment containing a set of fields that will be returned to the xref:#_validators[Validators] and/or xref:#_reactors[Reactors] for processing.
| xref:#hooks[Hook]                           | The name of the trigger for the trigger event. The underlying `action_trigger.hook` table defines the Fieldmapper class in the core_type column off of which the rest of the field definitions "hang".
| Enabled                        | Sets the given trigger as enabled or disabled. This must be set to enabled for the Action trigger to run.
| Processing Delay               | Defines how long after a given trigger / hook event has occurred before the associated action ("Reactor") will be taken.
| Processing Delay Context Field | Defines the field associated with the event on which the processing delay is calculated.
| Processing Group Context Field | Used to batch actions based on its associated group.
| Reactor                        | Links the action trigger to the Reactor.
| xref:#_validator[Validator]                      | The subroutines receive the trigger environment as an argument and return either _1_ if the validator is _true_ or _0_ if the validator returns _false_.
| Event Repeatability Delay      | Allows events to be repeated after this delay interval.
| Failure Cleanup                | After an event is reacted to and if there is a failure a cleanup module can be run to clean up after the event.
| Granularity                    | Used to group events by how often they should be run.
| Max Event Validity Delay       | Allows events to have a range of time that they are valid.
| Message Library Path           | Defines the org_unit object for a Patron Message Center message.
| Message Template               | A Template Toolkit template that can be used to generate output for a Patron Message Center message.
| Message Title                  | The title that will display on a Patron Message Center message.
| Message User Path              | Defines the user object for a Patron Message Center message.
| Opt-In Settings Type           | Choose which User Setting Type will decide if this event will be valid for a certain user.
| Opt-In User Field              | Set to the name of the field in the selected hook's core type that will link the core type to the actor.usr table.
| Success Cleanup                | After an event is reacted to successfully a cleanup module can be run to clean up after the event.
| Template                       | A Template Toolkit template that can be used to generate output.
|===

=== Hooks ===

Hooks define the class in the Fieldmapper that an action trigger will listen
for.
Essentially, a hook represents an event that may occur in the system.

.Hook Fields
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Field*        | *Description*
| Hook Key       | A unique name given to the hook.
| Core Type      | Used to link the action trigger to the IDL class in `fm_IDL.xml`
| Description    | Text to describe the purpose of the hook.
| Passive        | Indicates whether or not an event is created by direct user action or is circumstantial.
|===

==== Passive vs. Active Hooks ====

*Passive Hooks*: These hooks require a periodic check by a cron job to
determine whether an event has occurred.
Examples include:

* Checking if an item is overdue by a certain number of days.
* Sending notifications for upcoming due dates.

These hooks rely on background jobs to scan the database and create relevant
events when conditions are met.

*Active Hooks*: These hooks are triggered automatically when a predefined
event occurs.
Examples include:

* A hold becoming available.
* An item being checked in.

Since these events are already occurring within the systemâ€™s normal
workflow, the action trigger framework can immediately create an event
without requiring a periodic check.

=== Reactors ===

Reactors link the trigger definition to the action to be carried out.

.Reactor Fields
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Field*        | *Description*
| Module Name  | The name of the Module to run if the action trigger is validated. It must be defined as a subroutine in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor.pm` or as a module in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor/*.pm`.
| Description  | Description of the Action to be carried out.
|===

==== CallHTTP Reactor ====

The CallHTTP reactor allows Evergreen to send HTTP or HTTPS requests to an
external service.
This is useful for integrations, such as sending push notifications or
making API calls to external applications.
The HTTP request is configured using a Template Toolkit template that
formats the request.

===== CallHTTP Reactor Template Syntax =====

The template should output data that can be parsed by the Config::General
Perl module.
See: https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::General

Top-level settings should include the HTTP *method* and the *url*.

A block called *Headers* can be used to supply arbitrary HTTP headers.

A block called *Parameters* can be used to append CGI parameters to the URL,
most useful for GET form submission.

A HEREDOC called *content* can be used with POST or PUT to send an arbitrary
block of content to the remote server.

If the requested URL requires Basic or Digest authentication, the template
can include top-level configuration parameters to supply a *user*,
*password*, *realm*, and hostname:port *location*.

A default user agent string of "EvergreenReactor/1.0" is used when sending
requests.
This can be overridden using the top-level *agent* setting.

Example template for the *bib.edit* hook:

[source,xml]
----
method   post
url      https://example.com/api/incoming-update
agent    MySpecialAgent/0.1

user     updater
password uPd4t3StufF
realm    "Secret area"
location example.com:443

<Headers>
  Accept-Language en
</Headers>

<Parameters>
  type bib
  id   [% target.id %]
</Parameters>

content <<MARC
[% target.marc %]
MARC
----

=== Validators ===

Validators set the validation test to be performed to determine whether the
action trigger is executed.

.Validator Fields
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Field*         | *Description*
| Module Name   | The name of the subroutine in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor.pm` to validate the action trigger.
| Description   | Description of validation test to run.
|===

A validator function runs when the action trigger executes and returns
either true or false.
For example, a validator for overdue notices may check whether the item is
still checked out before sending the notification.

== Creating Action Triggers ==

. Make sure you are in the Event Definitions tab of the Notifications / Action Triggers module.

[TIP]
====
In most scenarios, you will not need to create new hooks, validators, or
reactors, but advanced users may find it useful to do so to add custom
functionality.

=== Creating Alternate Message Templates ===
indexterm:[Localization, Notices, Localized Notices]

As of version 3.9, there is the ability to create alternate templates for
Action Triggers that will generate locale-specific output for Action
Triggers.

To use the feature, the following UI elements have been added:

* When you double-click on an Event Definition under Notifications / Action
  Triggers to edit it, there will be a tab option for _Edit Alternate
  Template_ if the reactor is *ProcessTemplate*, *SendEmail*, or *SendSMS*.
* In the Patron Registration and Patron Editor screens, staff members may
  select a locale for a patron and edit it in the _Patron Preferred
  Language_ field.
* Patrons may set their own locale in the My Account interface off the OPAC
  by going to _Preferences --> Personal Information_ and setting the
  _Preferred Language_ field.

The templates used on the Edit Definition tab are the defaults that are used
if there are no alternate templates available that match the preferred
language.

Valid locales are the codes defined in the `i18n_locale` table in the config
schema.

=== Cloning Existing Action Triggers ===

. Right-click on the line of the action trigger you wish to clone, and choose _Clone Selected_.
.. You will be asked to confirm whether or not you wish to clone the event definition environment along with the action trigger.
. An editing window will open. Notice that the fields will be populated with content from the cloned action trigger. Edit as necessary and give the new action trigger a unique Name.
. Click _Save_.

== Editing Action Triggers ==

. Double-click on the action trigger you wish to edit or right-click on the line of the action trigger you wish to edit, and choose _Edit Event Definition_.
. The Edit Definition screen will appear. When you are finished editing, click _Save_ at the bottom of the form. Or click _Back to Notification/Action Triggers_ to exit without saving.

== Deleting Action Triggers ==

. Right-click on the line of the action trigger you wish to delete.
. Choose _Delete Selected_ from the action menu.

[NOTE]
====
Before deleting an action trigger, you should consider disabling it through
the editing form.
This way you can keep it for future use or cloning.
====

== Testing Action Triggers ==

. Go to the list of action triggers.
. Double-click on the action trigger you wish to edit or right-click on the line of the action trigger you wish to edit, and choose _Edit Event Definition_.
. Go to the _Run Tests_ tab.
. If there is a test available, fill in the required information and click _Go_.
. View the output of the test.

[WARNING]
====
If you are testing an email or SMS notification, use a test account and
email as an example.
Using the Test feature will actually result in the notification being sent
if configured correctly.
Similarly, use a test item or barcode when testing a circulation-based event
like Mark Lost since the test will mark the item as lost.
====

== Processing Action Triggers ==

To run action triggers, an Evergreen administrator will need to run the
trigger processing script.
This should be set up as a cron job to run periodically.
To run the script, use this command:

----
/openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --process-hooks --run-pending
----

.Table of Script Options
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| *Option* | *Description*
| --run-pending | Run pending events to send emails or take other actions as specified by the reactor in the event definition.
| --process-hooks | Create hook events.
| --osrf-config=[config_file] | OpenSRF core config file. Defaults to: /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml.
| --custom-filters=[filter_file] | File containing a JSON Object which describes any hooks that should use a user-defined filter to find their target objects. Defaults to: /openils/conf/action_trigger_filters.json.
| --max-sleep=[seconds] | When in process-hooks mode, wait up to [seconds] for the lock file to go away. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).
| --hooks=hook1[,hook2,hook3,...] | Define which hooks to create events for. If none are defined, it defaults to the list of hooks defined in the --custom-filters option. Requires --process-hooks.
| --granularity=[label] | Limit creating events and running pending events to those only with [label] granularity setting.
| --debug-stdout | Print server responses to STDOUT (as JSON) for debugging.
| --lock-file=[file_name] | Sets the lock file for the process.
| --verbose | Show details of script processing.
| --help | Show help information.
|===

Examples:

* Run all pending events that have no granularity set.
  This is what you tell CRON to run at regular intervals.
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending
----

* Batch create all "checkout.due" events
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --hooks=checkout.due --process-hooks
----

* Batch create all events for a specific granularity and to send notices for
  all pending events with that same granularity.
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending --granularity=Hourly --process-hooks
----

=== Setting Up Cron Jobs ===

Many action triggers are processed using cron jobs.
Passive hooks require periodic execution, typically scheduled at intervals
such as hourly or daily.
Stock Evergreen runs the action trigger runner every 30 minutes to process
pending events.

==== Example Cron Job ====

To periodically check for events and execute action triggers, administrators
can set up a cron job with the following command:

----
/openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --process-hooks --run-pending
----

This command:

* Processes hooks (--process-hooks) to create new events.
* Runs pending events (--run-pending) to execute any triggered actions.

==== Example Cron Job Setup ====

A standard Evergreen setup might include cron jobs like:

----
0 * * * * perl /openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending
30 * * * * perl /openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --process-hooks
----

This means:

* Every hour on the hour (0 * * * *), Evergreen processes pending actions.
* Every 30 minutes past the hour (30 * * * *), Evergreen scans for new
  events.

==== Granularity in Cron Jobs ====

Granularity settings allow different types of events to run at different
frequencies:

----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending --granularity=Hourly
----

This ensures that only events tagged with Hourly granularity will be
executed.

== Configure OPAC Record Email and Print ==

The information displayed in the printout and email is defined and generated
by two Notification/Action Triggers named `biblio.record_entry.print` and
`biblio.record_entry.email`.

By default, the printout and email will include the following bibliographic
information:

* Bibliographic Record ID
* Title statement
* Author
* Item Type
* Publisher
* Publication date
* ISBN
* ISSN
* UPC

If the OPAC user selects *Full display*, the following holdings information
is included in the printout or email, if relevant:

* Circulating Library
* Item Location
* Call Number (including prefix and suffix)
* Monograph Parts
* Item Status
* Item Barcode

The bibliographic and item information included in the printout or email can
be configured by modifying the respective Action Trigger templates.

To configure the maximum number of copies displayed per record for the Full
display, follow these steps:

1. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Notifications / Action
   Triggers*.
2. Find the print or email notification/action trigger you wish to modify.
+
.Email and Print Event Definitions
image::actiontriggers/ope_event_defs.png[Email and Print Event Definitions]
3. Double-click on the action trigger.
4. Select the *Edit Parameters* tab.
5. In the upper left-hand corner, select *New Parameter* to create a new
   Trigger Event Parameter.
+
.Email and Print Event Parameters
image::actiontriggers/ope_event_params.png[Email and Print Event Parameters]
6. In the _Parameter Name_ field, enter `holdings_limit`.
7. In the _Parameter Value_ field, enter the maximum number of copies to be
   displayed per record.
8. Select *Save* to save your changes.
