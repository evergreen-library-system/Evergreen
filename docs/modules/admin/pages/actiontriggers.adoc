indexterm:[action triggers, event definitions, notifications]

Action Triggers give administrators the ability to set up actions for
specific events. They are useful for notification events such as hold notifications.

To access the Action Triggers module, select *Administration* -> *Local Administration* ->  *Notifications / Action triggers*.

[NOTE]
==========
You must have Local Administrator permissions to access the Action Triggers module.
==========

You will notice four tabs on this page: <<event_definitions, Event Definitions>>, <<hooks, Hooks>>, <<reactors, Reactors>> and <<validators, Validators>>.


[#event_definitions]

== Event Definitions ==

Event Definitions is the main tab and contains the key fields when working with action triggers. These fields include:

=== Table 1: Action Trigger Event Definitions ===


|==============================================
|*Field*                         |*Description*
| Owning Library                 |The shortname of the library for which the action / trigger / hook is defined.
| Name                           |The name of the trigger event, that links to a trigger event environment containing a set of fields that will be returned to the <<validators, Validators>> and/or <<reactors, Reactors>> for processing.
| <<hooks, Hook>>                |The name of the trigger for the trigger event. The underlying `action_trigger.hook` table defines the Fieldmapper class in the core_type column off of which the rest of the field definitions "hang".
| Enabled                        |Sets the given trigger as enabled or disabled. This must be set to enabled for the Action trigger to run.
| Processing Delay               |Defines how long after a given trigger / hook event has occurred before the associated action ("Reactor") will be taken.
| Processing Delay Context Field |Defines the field associated with the event on which the processing delay is calculated. For example, the processing delay context field on the `hold.capture` hook (which has a `core_type` of `ahr`) is _capture_time_.
| Processing Group Context Field |Used to batch actions based on its associated group.
| <<reactors, Reactor>>          |Links the action trigger to the Reactor.
| <<validators, Validator>>      |The subroutines receive the trigger environment as an argument and return either _1_ if the validator is _true_ or _0_ if the validator returns _false_.
| Event Repeatability Delay      |Allows events to be repeated after this delay interval.
| Failure Cleanup                |After an event is reacted to and if there is a failure a cleanup module can be run to clean up after the event.
| Granularity                    |Used to group events by how often they should be run. Options are Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, but you may also create new values.
| Max Event Validity Delay       |Allows events to have a range of time that they are valid.  This value works with the *Processing Delay* to define a time range.
| Message Library Path           |Defines the org_unit object for a Patron Message Center message.
| Message Template               |A Template Toolkit template that can be used to generate output for a Patron Message Center message.  The output may or may not be used by the reactor or another external process.
| Message Title                  |The title that will display on a Patron Message Center message.
| Message User Path              |Defines the user object for a Patron Message Center message.
| Opt-In Settings Type           |Choose which User Setting Type will decide if this event will be valid for a certain user.  Use this to allow users to Opt-In or Opt-Out of certain events.
| Opt-In User Field              |Set to the name of the field in the selected hook's core type that will link the core type to the actor.usr table. 
| Success Cleanup                |After an event is reacted to successfully a cleanup module can be run to clean up after the event.
| Template                       |A Template Toolkit template that can be used to generate output.  The output may or may not be used by the reactor or another external process.

    Total Owed For Transaction: [% circ.billable_transaction.summary.total_owed %]
    Library: [% circ.circ_lib.name %]
  [% END %]

. Once you are satisfied with your new event trigger, click the _Save_ button located at the bottom of the form.


[TIP]
=========
A quick and easy way to create new action triggers is to clone an existing action trigger.
=========

[[creating_alternate_message_templates]]
==== Creating Alternate Message Templates ====
indexterm:[Localization, Notices, Localized Notices]

As of version 3.9 there is the ability to create alternate templates for Action Triggers that will generate locale specific out for Action Triggers.  If you send notices in multiple languages, we recommend putting some words to that effect in your notice templates.  The template, message and message title can all be localized.  To use the feature the following UI elements have been added:

* When you double-click on an Event Definition under Notifications / Action Triggers to edit it there will be a tab option for _Edit Alternate Template_ if the reactor is *ProcessTemplate*, *SendEmail*, or *SendSMS*. Note that this feature does not automatically translate existing templates, and an Evergreen administrator must create new alternate templates for each desired locale.
* In the Patron Registration and Patron Editor screens staff members may select a locale for a patron and edit it in the _Patron Preferred Language_ field.
* Patrons may set their own locale in the My Account interface off the OPAC by going to _Preferences --> Personal Information_ and setting the _Preferred Language_ field.

The templates used on the Edit Definition tab are the defaults that are used if there are no alternate templates available that match the preferred language.  If alternate templates are available the system will use a locale that is an exact match and then if failing that use one where the language code matches and then fall back to the default one.

For example, if a patron has a locale of fr-CA and there are templates for both fr-CA and fr-FR it will use the fr-CA.  If the fr-CA template was deleted it would fall back on using the fr-FR for the patron since it at least shares the same base language.

Valid locales are the codes defined in the `i18n_locale` table in the config schema.




=== Cloning Existing Action Triggers ===

. Right click on the line of the action trigger you wish to clone, and choose _Clone Selected_.
.. You will be asked to confirm whether or not you wish to clone the event definition environment along with the action trigger.
. An editing window will open. Notice that the fields will be populated with content from the cloned action trigger. Edit as necessary and give the new action trigger a unique Name.
. Click _Save_.

=== Editing Action Triggers ===

. Double-click on the action trigger you wish to edit or right click on the line of the action trigger you wish to edit, and choose _Edit Event Definition_.
. The Edit Definition screen will appear. When you are finished editing, click _Save_ at the bottom of the form. Or click _Back to Notification/Action Triggers_ to exit without saving.


=== Deleting Action Triggers ===

. Right click on the line of the action trigger you wish to delete.
. Choose _Delete Selected_ ofrom the action menu.

[NOTE]
============
Before deleting an action trigger, you should consider disabling it through the editing form. This way you can keep it for future use or cloning.
============

=== Testing Action Triggers ===

. Go to the list of action triggers.
. . Double-click on the action trigger you wish to edit or right click on the line of the action trigger you wish to edit, and choose _Edit Event Definition_.
. Go to the _Run Tests_ tab.
. If there is a test available, fill in the required information and click _Go_.
. View the output of the test.

WARNING: If you are testing an email or SMS notification, use a test account and email as an example. Using the Test feature will actually result in the notification being sent if configured correctly.  Similarly, use a test item or barcode when testing a circulation-based event like Mark Lost since the test will mark the item as lost.

[#hooks]

=== Hooks ===

Hooks define the Fieldmapper class in the core_type column off of which the rest of the field definitions "hang".


==== Table 2. Hooks ====


|=======================
| *Field*        | *Description*
| Hook Key       | A unique name given to the hook.
| Core Type      | Used to link the action trigger to the IDL class in `fm_IDL.xml`
| Description    | Text to describe the purpose of the hook.
| Passive        | Indicates whether or not an event is created by direct user action or is circumstantial.
|=======================

You may also create, edit and delete Hooks but the Core Type must refer to an IDL class in the `fm_IDL.xml` file.


[#reactors]

=== Reactors ===

Reactors link the trigger definition to the action to be carried out.

==== Table 3. Action Trigger Reactors ====


|=======================
| Field        | Description
| Module Name  | The name of the Module to run if the action trigger is validated. It must be defined as a subroutine in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor.pm` or as a module in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor/*.pm`.
| Description  | Description of the Action to be carried out.
|=======================

You may also create, edit and delete Reactors. Just remember that there must be an associated subroutine or module in the Reactor Perl module.

==== CallHTTP Reactor ====

This Action/Trigger reactor module allows an Evergreen administrator to
create event defintions that use HTTP (or HTTPS) to contact external services
and let them know that something has happened in Evergreen.

For instance, a discovery layer can be informed when a bib record is updated
or when a user's barcode changes.

===== CallHTTP Reactor Template Syntax =====

The new reactor module uses a template to define its behavior.  While the
template is processed by Template Toolkit, as with any A/T templates, its
output format is new to Evergreen.

The template should output data that can be parsed by the Config::General Perl
module.  See: https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::General

Top level settings should include the HTTP *method* and the *url*.

A block called *Headers* can be used to supply arbitrary HTTP headers.

A block called *Parameters* can be used to append CGI parameters to the URL,
most useful for GET form submission.  Repeated parameters are allowed.  If
this block is used, the URL should /not/ contain any parameters, use one or
the other.

A HEREDOC called *content* can be used with POST or PUT to send an arbitrary block
of content to the remote server.

If the requested URL requires Basic or Digest authentication, the template can
include top level configuration parameters to supply a *user*, *password*, *realm*,
and hostname:port *location*.

A default user agent string of "EvergreenReactor/1.0" is used when sending requests.
This can be overridden using the top level *agent* setting.

Here is an example template that could be used by a definition attached to the
*bib.edit* hook:

[source,conf]
----
method   post # Valid values are post, get, put, delete, head
url      https://example.com/api/incoming-update
agent    MySpecialAgent/0.1

user     updater
password uPd4t3StufF
realm    "Secret area"
location example.com:443

<Headers>
  Accept-Language en
</Headers>

<Parameters>
  type bib
  id   [% target.id %]
</Parameters>

content <<MARC
[% target.marc %]
MARC
----




[#validators]

=== Validators ===

Validators set the validation test to be preformed to determine whether the action trigger is executed.

==== Table 4. Action Trigger Validators ====


|=======================
| Field         | Description
| Module Name   | The name of the subroutine in `/openils/lib/perl5/OpenILS/Application/Trigger/Reactor.pm` to validate the action trigger.
| Description   | Description of validation test to run.
|=======================

You may also create, edit and delete Validators. Just remember that their must be an associated subroutine in the Reactor.pm Perl module.

[#processing_action_triggers]
== Processing Action Triggers ==

To run action triggers, an Evergreen administrator will need to run the trigger processing script. This should be set up as a cron job to run periodically. To run the script, use this command:

----
/openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --process-hooks --run-pending
----

You have several options when running the script:

* --run-pending: Run pending events to send emails or take other actions as
specified by the reactor in the event definition.

* --process-hooks: Create hook events

* --osrf-config=[config_file]: OpenSRF core config file. Defaults to:
/openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml

* --custom-filters=[filter_file]: File containing a JSON Object which describes any hooks
that should use a user-defined filter to find their target objects. Defaults to:
/openils/conf/action_trigger_filters.json

* --max-sleep=[seconds]: When in process-hooks mode, wait up to [seconds] for the lock file to go
away. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

* --hooks=hook1[,hook2,hook3,...]: Define which hooks to create events for. If none are defined, it
defaults to the list of hooks defined in the --custom-filters option.
Requires --process-hooks.

* --granularity=[label]: Limit creating events and running pending events to
those only with [label] granularity setting.

* --debug-stdout: Print server responses to STDOUT (as JSON) for debugging.

* --lock-file=[file_name]: Sets the lock file for the process.

* --verbose: Show details of script processing.

* --help: Show help information.

Examples:

* Run all pending events that have no granularity set. This is what you tell
CRON to run at regular intervals.
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending
----

* Batch create all "checkout.due" events
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --hooks=checkout.due --process-hooks
----

* Batch create all events for a specific granularity and to send notices for all
pending events with that same granularity.
+
----
perl action_trigger_runner.pl --run-pending --granularity=Hourly --process-hooks
----

[[configure_opac_email_print]]
== Configure OPAC Record Email and Print ==

The information displayed in the printout and email is defined and generated by two new Notification/Action Triggers named `biblio.record_entry.print` and `biblio.record_entry.email`.  

The printout and email will include the following bibliographic information by default:

* Bibliographic Record ID 
* Title statement 
* Author 
* Item Type
* Publisher 
* Publication date 
* ISBN 
* ISSN
* UPC

If *Full display* is selected by the OPAC user, the following holdings information is included in the printout or email, if relevant:

* Circulating Library
* Item Location
* Call Number (including prefix and suffix)
* Monograph Parts
* Item Status
* Item Barcode

The bibliographic and item information included in the printout or email can be configured by modifying the respective Action Trigger templates.  

For the Full display, the maximum number of copies to be displayed per record can also be configured in the Action Trigger Event Parameter field.  To set the maximum number of copies for display, go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Notifications / Action Triggers* and find the print or email notification/action trigger to modify.  

. Double click on the action trigger you wish to modify
+
image::actiontriggers/ope_event_defs.png[Email and Print Event Definitions]
