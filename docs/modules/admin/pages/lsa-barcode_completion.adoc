indexterm:[Barcode Completion,Lazy Circ]

The Barcode Completion feature gives users the ability to only enter the 
unique part of patron and item barcodes.  This can significantly reduce the 
amount of typing required for manual barcode input.

This feature can also be used if there is a difference between what the 
barcode scanner outputs and what is stored in the database, as long as the 
barcode that is stored has more characters then what the scanner is 
outputting. Barcode Completion is additive only; you cannot use it to match a
stored barcode that has less characters than what is entered. For example, if 
your barcode scanners previously output *a123123b* and now exclude the prefix 
and suffix, you could match both formats using Barcode Completion rules.

Because this feature adds an extra database search for each enabled rule to 
the process of looking up a barcode, it can add extra delays to the check-out 
process.  Please test in your environment before using in production.

== Scoping and Permissions ==

*Local Administrator* permission is needed to access the admin interface of the 
Barcode Completion feature.

Each rule requires an owner org unit, which is how scoping of the rules is 
handled.  Rules are applied for staff users with the same org unit or 
descendants of that org unit.
  

== Access Points ==

The admin interface for Barcode Completion is located under *Administration* 
-> *Local Administration* -> *Barcode Completion*.

NOTE: Barcode completion is also available during check out if library
setting "Load patron from Checkout" is set.
(Automatically detects if an actor/user barcode is scanned during
check out, and starts a new check out session using that user.)

NOTE: Barcode Completion does not work in the 
 *Search for Patron [by Name]* interface. 


== Multiple Matches ==

If multiple barcodes are matched, say if you have both "123" and "00000123" 
as valid barcodes, you will receive a list of all the barcodes that match all 
the rules that you have configured.  It doesn't stop after the first rule 
that matches, or after the first valid barcode is found.

== Barcode Completion Data Fields ==

The following data fields can be set for each Barcode Completion rule.

.Barcode Completion Fields
|=======
|*Active*          | Check to indicate entry is active. *Required*
|*Owner*           | Setting applies to this Org Unit and to all children. *Required*
|*Prefix*          | Sequence that appears at the beginning of barcode.
|*Suffix*          | Sequence that appears at the end of barcode.
|*Length*          | Total length of barcode.
|*Padding*         | Character that pads out non-unique characters in the barcode.
|*Padding At End*  | Check if the padding starts at the end of the barcode.
|*Applies to Items*| Check if entry applies to item barcodes.
|*Applies to Users*| Check if entry applies to user barcodes.
|=======


.Length and Padding

Length and Padding are related, you cannot use one without the other.  If a barcode 
has to be a certain length, then it needs to be able to be padded out to that length.  
If a barcode has padding, then we need to know the max length that we need to pad out 
to.  If length is set to blank or zero, or padding is left blank then they are both 
ignored.


.Applies to Items/Users
One or both of these options must be checked for the rule to have any effect.

== Create, Update, Filter, Delete/Disable Rules ==

image::barcode_completion/barcode_completion_grid.jpg[Barcode Completion Admin]

In the Barcode Completion admin interface at *Administration* -> *Local Administration* 
-> *Barcode Completion* you can create, update and disable rules.

=== Create Rules ===
To create a new rule click on the *New* button in the upper right corner.  
When you are are done with editing the new rule click the *Save* button.  If 
you want to cancel the new rule creation click the *Cancel* button.

=== Update Rules ===
To edit a rule double click on the rule in the main list.

=== Filter Rules ===
It may be useful to filter the rules list if there are a large number of 
rules.  Click on the *filter* link to bring up the *Filter Results* dialog 
box.  You can filter on any of the data fields and you can setup multiple 
filter rules.  Click *Apply* to enable the filter rules, only the rows that match 
will now be displayed.

To clear out the filter rules, delete all of the filter rules by clicking the
*X* next to each rule, and then click *Apply*.

=== Delete/Disable Rules ===
It isn't possible to delete a rule from the database from the admin interface.  
If a rule is no longer needed set *Active* to "False" to disable it.  To keep 
the number of rules down, reuse inactive rules when creating new rules.

== Examples ==

In all these examples, the unique part of the barcode is *123*.  So that is 
all that users will need to type to match the full barcode.

=== Barcode With Prefix and Padding ===

Barcode: *4545000123*

To match this 10 character barcode by only typing in *123* we need the 
following settings.

 * *Active* - Checked
 * *Owner* - Set to your org unit.
 * *Prefix* - 4545 - This is the prefix that the barcode starts with.
 * *Length* - 10 - Total length of the barcode.
 * *Padding* - 0 - Zeros will be used to pad out non significant parts of the barcode.
 * *Applies to Items* and/or *Applies to Users* - Checked

The system takes the *123* that you entered and adds the prefix to the beginning 
of it.  Then adds zeros between the prefix and your number to pad it out to 
10 characters.  Then it searches the database for that barcode.

=== Barcode With Suffix ===

Barcode: *123000book*

To match this 10 character barcode by only typing in *123* we need the 
following settings.

 * *Active* - Checked
 * *Owner* - Set to your org unit.
 * *Suffix* - book - This is the suffix that the barcode ends with.
 * *Length* - 10 - Total length of the barcode.
 * *Padding* - 0 - Zeros will be used to pad out non significant parts of the barcode.
 * *Padding at End* - Checked
 * *Applies to Items* and/or *Applies to Users* - Checked

The system takes the *123* that you entered and adds the suffix to the end of it.  
Then adds zeros between your number and the suffix to pad it out to 10 
characters.  Then it searches the database for that barcode.

=== Barcode With Left Padding ===

Barcode: *0000000123*

To match this 10 character barcode by only typing in *123* we need the 
following settings.

 * *Active* - Checked
 * *Owner* - Set to your org unit.
 * *Length* - 10 - Total length of the barcode.
 * *Padding* - 0 - Zeros will be used to pad out non significant parts of the barcode.
 * *Applies to Items* and/or *Applies to Users* - Checked

The system takes the *123* that you entered, then adds zeros between your 
number and the left to pad it out to 10 characters.  Then it searches the 
database for that barcode.

=== Barcode With Right Padding ===

Barcode: *1230000000*

To match this 10 character barcode by only typing in *123* we need the 
following settings.

 * *Active* - Checked
 * *Owner* - Set to your org unit.
 * *Length* - 10 - Total length of the barcode.
 * *Padding* - 0 - Zeros will be used to pad out non significant parts of the barcode.
 * *Padding at End* - Checked
 * *Applies to Items* and/or *Applies to Users* - Checked

The system takes the *123* that you entered, then adds zeros between your 
number and the right to pad it out to 10 characters.  Then it searches the 
database for that barcode.

=== Barcode of any Length with Prefix and Suffix ===

Barcode: *a123b*

To match this 5 character barcode by only typing in *123* we need the 
following settings.  This use of Barcode Completion doesn't save many 
keystrokes, but it does allow you to handle the case where your barcode 
scanners at one point were set to output a prefix and suffix which was stored 
in the database.  Now your barcode scanners no longer include the prefix and suffix.  
These settings will simply add the prefix and suffix to any barcode entered and 
search for that.

 * *Active* - Checked
 * *Owner* - Set to your org unit.
 * *Length/Padding* - 0/null - Set the length to 0 and/or leave the padding blank. 
 * *Prefix* - a - This is the prefix that the barcode starts with.
 * *Suffix* - b - This is the suffix that the barcode starts with.
 * *Applies to Items* and/or *Applies to Users* - Checked

The system takes the *123* that you entered, then adds the prefix and suffix 
specified.  Then it searches the database for that barcode.  Because no length 
or padding was entered, this rule will add the prefix and suffix to any 
barcode that is entered and then search for that valid barcode.


== Testing ==

To test this feature, setup the rules that you want, then setup items/users 
with barcodes that should match.  Then try scanning the short version of 
those barcodes in the various supported access points.
