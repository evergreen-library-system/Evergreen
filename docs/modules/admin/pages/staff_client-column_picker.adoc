From many screens and lists, you can click on the column picker
drop-down menu to change which columns are displayed.

To show or hide a column, simply click the column name in the menu. For
more advanced control of column visibility and their position in the
grid, choose *Manage Columns* from the menu. The popup saves changes
as they are made.

Columns at the top of the list will appear at the left end of the grid.

To adjust the width of columns, choose *Manage Column Widths* from
the menu, then click the "Expand" or "Shrink" icons in each column.
These can be clicked multiple times to reach the desired width.

After customizing the display you may save your changes by choosing
*Save Columns* from the drop-down menu. These settings are stored in the
browser and are not connected with a specific login or registered
workstation. Each computer will need to be configured separately.

Some lists have a different design, and some of them can also be customized.
Simply right-click the header row of any of the columns, and the column
picker will appear. When you are finished customizing the display, scroll
to the bottom of the Column Picker window and click *Save*.
