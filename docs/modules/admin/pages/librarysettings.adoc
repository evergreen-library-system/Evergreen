== Settings Overview ==

The settings are grouped together in separate tables based on functions
and modules, which are affected by the setting. They are in the same
sequence as you see in the staff client. Each table describes the
available settings in the group and shows which can be changed on a
per-library basis. At the bottom is the table with a list of
 xref:#data_types[data types] with details about acceptable settings
values.

|Clear shelf copy status|Any copies that have not been put into reshelving, in-transit, or on-holds-shelf (for a new hold) during the clear shelf process will be put into this status. This is basically a purgatory status for copies waiting to be pulled from the shelf and processed by hand|Selection list|

This setting is meant to be used in conjunction with the setting "Pickup library soft stalling interval" and its value should be equal or less than the value in Pickup library soft stalling interval.|Duration|
|Pickup library soft stalling interval|When set for the pickup library, this specifies an interval during which opportunistic hold capture will only occur for items where both these factors are true: 1) the request time age is smaller than the interval (i.e. the request was placed within the interval); and 2) the scan library is equivalent to the pickup library. This setting takes precedence over "Soft stalling interval".|Duration|

Default is False.

|Org unit hiding depth|This will hide certain organizational units in the public OPAC if the Original Location (url param "ol") for the OPAC inherits this setting. This setting specifies an organizational unit depth, that together with the OPAC Original Location determines which section of the Organizational Hierarchy should be visible in the OPAC. For example, a stock Evergreen installation will have a 3-tier hierarchy (Consortium/System/Branch), where System has a depth of 1 and Branch has a depth of 2. If this setting contains a depth of 1 in such an installation, then every library in the System in which the Original Location belongs will be visible, and everything else will be hidden. A depth of 0 will effectively make every organizational visible. The embedded OPAC in the staff client ignores this setting.|Number|
