== Overview ==

The Booking Administration module helps library staff manage bookable resources. This includes defining resource types, attributes, and values, as well as creating and managing individual resources. Staff can map attributes and values to resources, ensuring accurate descriptions and easy searchability.

=== Accessing Booking Administration ===

Access the Booking Administration from the top menu bar in the staff client by navigating to *Administration -> Booking Administration*.

=== Non-Bibliographic Resources ===

Non-bibliographic resources are bookable items that are not traditional library materials, such as laptops, projectors, or meeting rooms. These resources can be managed through the Booking Administration module.

Non-bibliographic resources consist of resource types, attributes, and values. Each resource type can have multiple attributes, and each attribute can have multiple values. Individual resources are created and linked to their attributes and values using a resource attribute map.

== Additional Resources ==

The Booking module allows library staff to manage reservations for various bookable resources. For detailed instructions on creating, managing, and utilizing these reservations, see xref:circulation:booking.adoc[Booking Module].

== Creating Bookable Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

[NOTE]
====
A staff account with circulator permissions or higher is required to create bookable non-bibliographic resources, such as laptops, projectors, and meeting rooms.

Before creating resources, define resource types and their attributes. Each resource type can have multiple attributes, and each attribute can have multiple values. Once defined, create individual resources and link them to their attributes and values using the Resource Attribute Map.

== Editing Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

Staff with the required permissions can edit aspects of existing non-bibliographic resources. For example, resource type can be edited if the fine amount for a laptop changes from $2.00 to $5.00.

=== Editing Resource Types ===

. Bring up your list of resource types. Select *Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resource Types*.
. A list of current resource types will appear.
. Double-click anywhere on the line of the resource type you would like to edit.
. The resource type box will appear. Make your changes and click *Save*.
. Following the same procedure, you may edit Resource Attributes, Attribute Values, Resources, and Attribute Maps by selecting them in *Administration -> Booking Administration*.

== Deleting Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

. To delete a booking resource, go to *Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resources*.
. Select the checkbox in front of the resource you want to delete. Click *Delete Selected*. The resource will disappear from the list.
. Following the same procedure, you may delete Resource Attribute Maps.
. You may also delete Resource Attribute Values, Resource Attributes, and Resource Types. But you have to delete them in the reverse order when you create them to ensure the entry is not in use when you try to delete it.

This is the deletion order: Resource Attribute Map/Resources -> Resource Attribute Values -> Resource Attributes -> Resource Types.
