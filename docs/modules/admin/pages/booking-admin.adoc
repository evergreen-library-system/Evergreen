== Creating Bookable Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

Staff with the required permissions (Circulator and above) can create bookable non-bibliographic resources such as laptops, projectors, and meeting rooms.

The following pieces make up a non-bibliographic resource:

* Resource Type
* Resource Attribute
* Resource Attribute Values
* Resource
* Resource Attribute Map

You need to create resource types and resource attributes (features of the resource types), and add booking items (resources) to individual resource type. Each resource attribute may have multiple values. You need to link the applicable features (resource attributes and values) to individual item (resource) through the Resource Attribute Map. Before you create resources (booking items) you need to have a resource type and associated resource attributes and values, if any, for them.

=== Create New Resource Type ===

1) Select Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resource Types.

3) To create a new resource type, click New Resource Type towards the top of the screen.

== Editing Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

Staff with the required permissions can edit aspects of existing non-bibliographic resources. For example, resource type can be edited in the event that the fine amount for a laptop changes from $2.00 to $5.00.

=== Editing Resource Types ===

1) Bring up your list of resource types. Select Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resource Types.

== Deleting Non-bibliographic Resources ==

1) To delete a booking resource, go to Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resources.

2) Select the checkbox in front the resource you want to delete. Click Delete Selected. The resource will disappear from the list.

Following the same procedure you may delete Resource Attributes Maps.

You may also delete Resource Attribute Values, Resource Attributes and Resource Types. But you have to delete them in the reverse order when you create them to make sure the entry is not in use when you try to delete it.

This is the deletion order: Resource Attribute Map/Resources -> Resource Attribute Values -> Resource Attributes -> Resource Types.
