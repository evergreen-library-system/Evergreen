= Ebook API integration ==
:toc:

Evergreen supports integration with third-party APIs provided by OverDrive and
OneClickdigital.

When ebook API integration is enabled, the following features are supported:

 * Bibliographic records from these vendors that appear in your
public catalog will include vendor holdings and availability information.
 * Patrons can check out and place holds on OverDrive and OneClickdigital ebook
titles from within the public catalog. 
 * When a user is logged in, the public catalog dashboard and My Account
interface will include information about that user's checkouts and holds for
supported vendors.

WARNING: The ability to check out and place holds on ebook titles is an experimental
feature in 3.0.  It is not recommended for production use without careful
testing.

For API integration to work, you need to request API access from the
vendor and configure your Evergreen system according to the instructions
below.  You also need to configure the new `open-ils.ebook_api` service.

This feature assumes that you are importing MARC records supplied by the
vendor into your Evergreen system, using Vandelay or some other MARC
import method.  This feature does not search the vendor's online
collections or automatically import vendor records into your system; it
merely augments records that are already in Evergreen.

A future Evergreen release will add the ability for users to check out
titles, place holds, etc., directly via the public catalog.

== Ebook API service configuration ==

This feature uses the new `open-ils.ebook_api` OpenSRF service.  This
service must be configured in your `opensrf.xml` and `opensrf_core.xml`
config files for ebook API integration to work.  See
`opensrf.xml.example` and `opensrf_core.xml.example` for guidance.

The `open-ils.ebook_api` service looks up title and
patron information from specified ebook vendor APIs.

The Evergreen catalog accesses data from this service
through OpenSRF JS bindings.

The `OpenILS::Utils::HTTPClient` module is required
for this service.


== OverDrive API integration ==
Before enabling OverDrive API integration, you will need to request API
access from OverDrive.  OverDrive will provide the values to be used for
the following new org unit settings:

  * *OverDrive Basic Token*: The basic token used for API client
    authentication.  To generate your basic token, combine your client
    key and client secret provided by OverDrive into a single string
    ("key:secret"), and then base64-encode that string.  On Linux, you
    can use the following command: `echo -n "key:secret" | base64 -`
  * *OverDrive Account ID*: The account ID (a.k.a. library ID) for your
    OverDrive API account.
  * *OverDrive Website ID*: The website ID for your OverDrive API
    account.
  * *OverDrive Authorization Name*: The authorization name (a.k.a.
    library name) designated by OverDrive for your library.  If your
    OverDrive subscription includes multiple Evergreen libraries, you
    will need to add a separate value for this setting for each
    participating library.
  * *OverDrive Password Required*: If your library's OverDrive
    subscription requires the patron's PIN (password) to be provided
    during patron authentication, set this setting to "true."  If you do
    not require the patron's PIN for OverDrive authentication, set this
    setting to "false."  (If set to "true," the password entered by a
    patron when logging into the public catalog will be cached in plain text in
    memcached.)
  * *OverDrive Discovery API Base URI* and *OverDrive Circulation API
    Base URI*: By default, Evergreen uses OverDrive's production API, so
    you should not need to set a value for these settings.  If you want
    to use OverDrive's integration environment, you will need to add the
    appropriate base URIs for the discovery and circulation APIs.  See
    OverDrive's developer documentation for details.
  * *OverDrive Granted Authorization Redirect URI*: Evergreen does not
    currently support granted authorization with OverDrive, so this
    setting is not currently in use.

For more information, consult the
https://developer.overdrive.com/docs/getting-started[OverDrive API
documentation].

To enable OverDrive API integration, adjust the following public catalog settings
in `config.tt2`:

  * `ebook_api.enabled`: set to "true".
  * `ebook_api.overdrive.enabled`: set to "true".
  * `ebook_api.overdrive.base_uris`: list of regular expressions
    matching OverDrive URLs found in the 856$9 field of older OverDrive
    MARC records.  As of fall 2016, OverDrive's URL format has changed,
    and the record identifier is now found in the 037$a field of their
    MARC records, with "OverDrive" in 037$b.  Evergreen will check the
    037 field for OverDrive record identifiers; if your system includes
    older-style OverDrive records with the record identifier embedded in
    the 856 URL, you need to specify URL patterns with this setting.

== OneClickdigital API integration ==
Before enabling OneClickdigital API integration, you will need to
request API access from OneClickdigital.  OneClickdigital will provide
the values to be used for the following new org unit settings:

  * *OneClickdigital Library ID*: The identifier assigned to your
    library by OneClickdigital.
  * *OneClickdigital Basic Token*: Your client authentication token,
    supplied by OneClickdigital when you request access to their API.

For more information, consult the
http://developer.oneclickdigital.us/[OneClickdigital API documentation].

To enable OneClickdigital API integration, adjust the following public catalog
settings in `config.tt2`:

  * `ebook_api.enabled`: set to "true".
  * `ebook_api.oneclickdigital.enabled`: set to "true".
  * `ebook_api.oneclickdigital.base_uris`: list of regular expressions
    matching OneClickdigital URLs found in the 859$9 field of your MARC
    records.  Evergreen uses the patterns specified here to extract
    record identifiers for OneClickdigital titles.

== Additional configuration ==
Evergreen communicates with third-party vendor APIs using the new
`OpenILS::Utils::HTTPClient` module.  This module is configured using
settings in `opensrf.xml`.  The default settings should work for most
environments by default, but you may need to specify a custom location
for the CA certificates installed on your server.  You can also disable
SSL certificate verification on HTTPClient requests altogether, but
doing so is emphatically discouraged.
