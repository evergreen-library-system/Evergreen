The *Permissions*, or *Permissions List*, interface is where individual permissions can be managed from the staff client. The interface is accessed through *Administration* > *Server Administration* > *Permissions*. It displays the permissions available through your default installation of Evergreen along with any custom permissions that have been created locally. 

The table of permissions includes three columns: 

. *ID*: Displays the permission’s ID as it appears in the Evergreen database.
. *Code*: Displays the name of the permission as it appears in the Evergreen database.
. *Description*: States what action the permission allows the user to do.

The xref:appendix:permissions_list.adoc[Permissions List] in the appendix provides a list of available permissions with their descriptions.
