== Creating new shelving locations ==

To add a shelving location

. Click *New Shelving Location*.
+
image::shelving_location/shelving_location_new.png[New shelving location]
+
. Select your parameters for  your shelving locations.
.. Choose the owning Org Unit of the shelving location. 
.. Type the name of the shelving location in the name field.
.. _Is OPAC Visible?_, choose whether you would like items in this shelving location to appear in the catalog.
.. _Can Circulate?_ can items in this location circulate?
.. _Is Holdable?_ are items in this location holdable?
.. _Hold Capture Requires Verification_, choose whether or not you want hold capture to be verified. At the time of capture you will be asked to fulfill the hold. 
+

+
.. _Checkin Alert_, choose whether you would like a routing alert to appear when an item in this location is checked in. This is intended for special locations, such as 'Display', that may require special handling, or that temporarily contain items that are not normally in that location.
+
image::shelving_location/shelving_location_alert.png[Check in Alert message]
+
NOTE: By default, these alerts will only display when an item is checked in, _not_ when it is used to record an in-house use.+
To also display these alerts when an item in your location is scanned for in-house use, go to Administration > Local Administration > Library Settings Editor and set _Display shelving location check in alert for in-house-use_ to True.
+
.. _Is Deleted?_, this sets the deletion flag for a shelving location to yes. 
.. If you would like a prefix or suffix to be added to the call numbers of every volume in this location, enter it.
.. If you would like, add a URL to the _URL_ field.  When a URL is entered in this field, the associated shelving location will display as a link in the Public Catalog summary display. This link can be useful for retrieving maps or other directions to the shelving location to aid users in finding material.
. Select *Save*.

TIP: Whether an item can be circulated, is holdable, or visible in the catalog, is 
controlled by three factors: item status, shelving location, and item attributes (the 
options in the Copy Editor). Evergreen follows the aforementioned sequence to check the 
value of each factor until it encounters a NO. An item can be circulated, holdable or 
visible on OPAC when all three factors are set to YES.

== Editing shelving locations ==

. Select *Administration -> Local Administration -> Shelving Locations Editor*.
. Select the shelving location you would like to edit.
. Select the actions button and select _Edit Selected_. Or double click on the shelving location.
+

+
. Make your changes and click *Save*.

== Deleting shelving locations ==

You may only delete a shelving location if:

. it doesn't contain any items, or
. it only contains deleted items.

. Select *Administration -> Local Administration -> Shelving Locations Editor*.
. Select the shelving location you would like to delete.
. Select the actions button and select _Delete Selected_.

Evergreen preserves shelving locations in the database, so no statistical information is lost when a shelving location is deleted.

== Modifying shelving location order ==

By default Evergreen displays shelving locations in alphabetical order. This order can be modified per Org Unit. 

To modify the order of shelving locations, Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Shelving Location Order*

. Choose the Org Unit you are wanting to reorder.
. Drag and drop the locations until you are satisfied with their order.
. Click _Apply changes_.


== Shelving location groups ==

.Use case
****
Mayberry Public Library provides a scope allowing users to search for all children's materials in their library. The library's children's scope incorporates several shelving locations used at the library, including  picture Books, Children's Fiction, Children's Non-Fiction, Easy Readers, and Children's DVDs. The library also builds a similar scope for YA materials that incorporates several shelving locations.
****

This feature allows staff to create and name sets of shelving locations to use as a search filter in the catalog.  OPAC-visible groups will display within the library selector in the [.underline]#Public Catalog#.  When a user selects a group and performs a search, the set of results will be limited to records that have items in one of the shelving locations within the group.  Groups can live at any level of the library hierarchy and may include shelving locations from any parent org unit or child org unit.

NOTE: To work with shelving location groups, you will need the ADMIN_COPY_LOCATION_GROUP permission.

=== Create a shelving location group ===

. Click *Administration ->  Local Administration -> Shelving Location Groups*.
. At the top of the screen is a drop down menu that displays the org unit tree. Select the unit within the org tree to which you want to add a shelving location group. The shelving locations associated with the org unit appear in the shelving locations column.
. In the column called _Location Groups_, click _New_.
+
image::shelving_location/sl_groups_new.png[New Shelving Location Group]
+
. Choose how you want the shelving location group to display to patrons in the catalog's org unit tree in the OPAC. By default, when you add a new shelving location group, the group displays in the org unit tree beneath any branches or sub-libraries of its parental org unit. If you check the box adjacent to Display above orgs, then the group will appear above the branches or sub-libraries of its parental org unit.
. To make the shelving location group visible to users searching the public catalog, check the box adjacent to Is OPAC visible?
. Enter a _Name_ for the shelving location group.
. Click Save. The name of the shelving location group appears in the location groups.
. Select the shelving locations that you want to add to the group, and click Add. The shelving locations will populate the middle column, Group Entries.
. The shelving location group is now visible in the org unit tree in the catalog. Search the catalog to retrieve results from any of the shelving locations that you added to the shelving location group.

=== Order shelving location groups ===

If you create more than one shelving location group, then you can order the groups in the org unit tree.
