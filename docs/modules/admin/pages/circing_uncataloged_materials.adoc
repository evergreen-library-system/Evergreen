== Introduction ==

This section discusses settings for circulating items that are not cataloged.
Evergreen offers two ways to circulate an item that is not in the catalog:

* Pre-cataloged items (also known as on-the-fly items) have a barcode, as
well as some basic metadata which staff members enter at the time of checkout.
These are represented in Evergreen with an item record which has to be manually
deleted or transferred when it is no longer needed.

* Non-cataloged items (also known as ephemeral items) do not have barcodes,
have no metadata, and are not represented with an item record.  No fines
accrue on these materials, but Evergreen does collect statistics on these
circulations.

== Pre-cataloged item settings ==

indexterm:[on-the-fly circulation]
indexterm:[pre-cataloged items,routing to a different library]

By default, when a pre-cataloged item is created, Evergreen sets the _Circ Library_
field to the library where it was checked out.  You may change this so that the
circ library is set to a different library.  This can be helpful in cases where the
cataloger who fixes pre-cataloged items is at another library, and you'd like all
pre-cataloged items to be routed to that cataloger's library when they are returned.

To change this setting:

. Go to Administration > Local Administration > Library Settings Editor.
. Choose _Pre-cat Item Circ Lib_.
. Click _Edit_.
. Select the appropriate context.  For example, if all pre-cataloged items in your
system should have the same circ library, you should choose your system as the
context.
. Type in the shortname of the library that should be in the circ lib field.  Make
sure to type this correctly, or Evergreen won't be able to create pre-cataloged
items.

NOTE: Evergreen always sets the owning library of pre-cataloged items to be the
consortium.

== Non-cataloged item settings ==

indexterm:[ephemeral items]

In Evergreen, libraries may elect to create their own local non-cataloged item
types. For example, you may choose to circulate non-cataloged paperbacks or magazine
back-issues, but not wish to catalog them.

=== Adding a new non-cataloged type ===

. Go to Administration > Local Administration > Non-Cataloged Types Editor.
. Under _Create a new non-cataloged type_, start filling out the appropriate
  information.
. Choose an appropriate duration.  This period of time will be used to calculate
  a due date that is displayed to the patron on the patron's receipt and _My Account_
  view in the public catalog.  The item will be automatically removed from the
  _My Account_ view the day after the due date.
. The _Circulate In-House?_ checkbox is only for your records.  This checkbox does
  not affect how these materials circulate.
. Click the _Create_ button when you are done.

=== Deleting a non-cataloged type ===

. Go to Administration > Local Administration > Non-Cataloged Types Editor.
. Click the _Delete_ button next to the type you wish to delete.  Note that
  if any non-cataloged items of this type have ever been entered, you will
  not be able to delete it.
