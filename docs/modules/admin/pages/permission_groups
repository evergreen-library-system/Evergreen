= Permission Groups = 
:toc:

A permission group is a set of permissions that is assigned to each user's account. With the number of permissions that are available in Evergreen, it would be very difficult to manage them individually; permission groups provide a more efficient and consistent way to organize and assign permissions.
The permission group assigned to a user determines what specific functions they can perform in the public catalog and in the staff client. For example, patrons have a small set of permissions that allow them to log in to the public catalog, place holds, and update their account preferences. 
Staff permission groups are generally more extensive and complex, as they determine each specific function staff can perform their work in the staff client. 

Every user must be assigned at least one main permission group, or profile, in their account. Users can have multiple, or secondary, permission groups assigned to their account. The process of assigning a secondary permission group is covered in xref:admin_initial_setup/describing_your_people.html#secondaryperms[Secondary Permission Groups].

Permission groups can be managed in the staff client under *Administration* > *Server Administration* > *Permission Groups*.

Upon opening the interface, you will see a tree of the existing permission groups. With the first install of Evergreen, the tree will show the default permission groups, shown in the screenshot below. The groups can be modified to meet the needs of your library. 

image:://permission_groups/default permission group tree.png[Permission groups tree]

The tree can be collapsed or expanded using the arrows next to each parent permission group. Any group that is nested under another group is called a child group; each child group will inherit any permissions from their parent group(s). For example, in the list of default permission groups shown in the screenshot above, the Staff group inherits all permissions assigned to the Users group. The Catalogers group inherits permissions from the Users group _and_ Staff group.

To view the attributes and permissions of a group, click on the name of the group. To the right of the tree, two tabs will display: *Group Details* and *Group Permissions*. 


== Group Details == 

**Group Details** includes the following attributes of the permission group:

* _Name_: The name of the permission group.
* _Description_: The description of the permission group.
* _User Expiration Interval_: The interval at which the accounts assigned to the permission group expire; for example, 2 years.
* _Application Permission_: In the case you would like a specific group_application permission assigned to a permission group, which would allow for assigning and editing users assigned to the permission group, input that permission here. This is required to assign and edit accounts in this permission group. For example, the Patron permission group’s application permission is group_application.user.patron. Therefore, users must have that permission to assign other users to that permission group and edit user accounts within that group.
* _Hold Priority_: The priority given to that group in the holds queue. This field defaults to zero and can be set to a positive or negative number. The lower the number, the higher priority, so -1 results in a higher priority than the default of 0.
* _User Group?_: Indicates whether the permission group can have, or be assigned, to users. For example, the Staff permission group is the parent group to the staff subgroups (e.g., Circulator) and includes the permissions that all staff inherit. Users would not be directly assigned to the Staff group, so the User Group checkbox would be left unchecked, i.e., as false. Note that even if the permission group is not marked as a User Group, it will still inherit the base User permission group.
* _Multi-factor Authentication is allowed?_: Indicates whether Mult-factor Authentication (MFA) functionality is allowed when users with the permission group are logging in.
* _Multi-factor Authentication is required?_: Indicates whether Mult-factor Authentication (MFA) functionality is required when users with the permission group are logging in.

+
. Click *Add Child*.
+
image::permission_groups/permission_groups_add_child.png[Add child permission group]
+
. Fill out the form and click *Save*.
+
image::permission_groups/permission_groups_add_child_save.png[Save permission group details]
+

=== Editing Permission Group Details ===

To edit the details of a permission group:

. Select the name of the permission group from the tree.
. In the Group Details tab, click *Edit*.
+
image::permission_groups/permission_groups_edit.png[Edit permission group details]
+
. Make any necessary changes and click *Save*.
+

=== Deleting a Permission Group === 

To delete a permission group:

. Select the name of the permission group from the tree.
. Click *Delete*.
+
image::permission_groups/permission_groups_delete.png[Delete permission group]
+
. Click *Confirm*.

=== Permissions ===

* CREATE_PERM
* DELETE_PERM
* UPDATE_PERM

== Group Permissions==

The *Group Permissions* tab shows the list of permissions assigned to each group. Along with the permission code/name (ex: COPY_CHECKIN), you will see the following columns:

* _Group_: This shows the group the permission is assigned to. If a permission was inherited through a parent group, it will display the name of the parent group. The name displays as a link that connects to the parent group’s list of permissions.
* _Depth_: The scope at which the group has the permission. Note that if a permission is inherited, this value cannot be edited within the child group.
* _Grantable?_: Whether or not a user assigned to that permission group can assign the permission to another user. Note that if a permission is inherited, this value cannot be edited within the child group.
* _Delete?_: Select this checkbox if you want to remove a permission from the group (process discussed in next section.) Note that if a permission is inherited, this column will default to _Inherited_ instead of a checkbox, as inherited permissions cannot be removed from a child group.

If a permission is assigned locally to a specific group, the permissions table will look like the below:

image::permission_groups/permission_groups_perm_list_editable.png[Locally assigned permissions]

If a permission is inherited through a parent group, the permissions table will look like the below:

image::permission_groups/inherited permissions.png[Inherited permissions]

=== Filtering the Group Permissions List ===

Within the permissions list, you can search for a specific permission by using the Filter function.

image::permission_groups/permission_groups_filter.png[Group Permissions filter]

If you start typing in the field, the list of permissions will narrow down based on the value in the filter. The filter value sticks, so you can navigate through various groups in the tree and see if they have a certain permission.

To clear the Filter, press **Clear**.

+
image::permission_groups/Image: permission_groups_add_mapping.png[Add Mapping]
+
. In the *New Permission* field, start typing the name (code) of the permission you want to add and choose the permission from the dropdown list. If the permission is already assigned to the group, it will not show up in the dropdown menu.
+
image::permission_groups/Image: permission_groups_new_permission.png[New permission field]
+
. Choose the *Depth* from the dropdown list, and click the checkbox for *Grantable* if you would like to grant users in the permission group the ability to assign this permission to other permission groups.
+
image::permission_groups/Image:permission_groups_new_depth_grantability.png[New permission field]
