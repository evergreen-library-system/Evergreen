== Acquisitions Settings ==

indexterm:[acquisitions,permissions]

Several setting in the Library Settings area of the Administration module pertain to
functions in the Acquisitions module. You can access these settings by clicking
_Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor_.

* CAT: Delete bib if all copies are deleted via Acquisitions lineitem
cancellation - If you cancel a line item, then all of the on order copies in the
catalog are deleted. If, when you cancel a line item, you also want to delete
the bib record, then set this setting to TRUE.
* Allow funds to be rolled over without bringing the money along - enables you
to move a fund's encumbrances from one year to the next without moving unspent
money. Unused money is not added to the next year's fund and is not available
for use.
* Allows patrons to create automatic holds from purchase requests.
* Default circulation modifier - This modifier would be applied to items that
are created in the acquisitions module
* Default copy location - This copy location would be applied to items that are
created in the acquisitions module
* Fund Spending Limit for Block - When the amount remaining in the fund,
including spent money and encumbrances, goes below this percentage, attempts to
spend from the fund will be blocked.
* Fund Spending Limit for Warning - When the amount remaining in the fund,
including spent money and encumbrances, goes below this percentage, attempts to
spend from the fund will result in a warning to the staff.
* Rollover Distribution Formulae Funds - When set to true, during fiscal
rollover, all distribution formulae will update to use new funds.
* Set copy creator as receiver - When receiving a copy in acquisitions, set the
copy "creator" to be the staff that received the copy
* Temporary barcode prefix - Temporary barcode prefix for items that are created
in the acquisitions module
* Temporary call number prefix - Temporary call number prefix for items that are
created in the acquisitions module

== Cancel/Delay reasons ==

indexterm:[acquisitions,purchase order,cancellation]
indexterm:[acquisitions,line item,cancellation]

The Cancel reasons link enables you to predefine the reasons for which a line
item or a PO can be cancelled. A default list of reasons appears, but you can
add custom reasons to this list. Applying the cancel reason will prevent the
item from appearing in a claims list and will allow you to cancel debits
associated with the purchase. Cancel reasons also enable you to delay
a purchase. For example, you could create a cancel reason of 'back ordered,' and
you could choose to keep the debits associated with the purchase.

=== Create a cancel/delay reason ===

. To add a new cancel reason, click _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
Cancel reasons_.

. Click _New Cancel Reason_.

. Select a using library from the drop-down menu. The using library indicates
the organizational units whose staff can use this cancel reason. This menu is
populated with the shortnames that you created for your libraries in the
organizational units tree (See Administration -> Server Administration ->  Organizational
Units.)

. Create a label for the cancel reason. This label will appear when you select a
cancel reason on an item or a PO.

. Create a description of the cancel reason. This is a free text field and can
comprise any text of your choosing.

. If you want to retain the debits associated with the cancelled purchase, click
the box adjacent to Keep Debits->

. Click _Save_.

=== Delete a custom cancel/delay reason ===

You can delete custom cancel reason.

. Select the checkbox for the custom cancel reason that should be deleted.

. Click the _Delete Selected_ button.

[TIP]
You cannot select the checkbox for any of the default cancel reasons because the
system expects those reasons to be available to handle EDI order responses.

[[acq_currency]]
== Currencies and Exchange Rates ==

indexterm:[acquisitions,currency types] 

Currency types can be created to represent the various currencies a library may use for purchasing and acquisitions.  Currency types are applied to funds in the administrative module (Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Fund Administration -> Funds). When a fund is applied to a copy or line item for purchase, the item will be purchased in the currency associated with that fund.

image::acq_funds/currency1.PNG[Currencies and Exchange Rates]


=== Create a currency type ===

. To create a new currency type, go to _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Currencies and Exchange Rates_ and click _New Currency Type_.

[NOTE]
From the Currencies and Exchange Rates interface, you can delete currencies that have never been applied to funds or used to make purchases. Multiple delete is not available in this interface.

=== Exchange Rates ===

indexterm:[acquisitions,exchange rates]

Exchange rates define the rate of exchange between currencies. Evergreen will
automatically calculate exchange rates for purchases. 

==== Create an exchange rate ====

. To create an exchange rate, click on the _Manage Exchange Rates_ button associated with a specific Currency Type.

. For that specific Currency Type, indicate the current exchange rate with the other configured currencies.

. Click _Save_.

image::acq_funds/currency3.PNG[Create a New Exchange Rate]

Evergreen assumes that the currency of the purchasing fund is identical to the currency of the provider, but it provides for two unique situations: 
. If the currency of the fund that is used for the purchase is different from the currency of the provider as listed in the provider profile, then Evergreen will use the exchange rate to calculate the price of the item in the currency of the fund and debit the fund accordingly. 
. When money is transferred between funds that use different currency types, Evergreen will automatically use the exchange rate to convert the money to the currency of the receiving fund.

[[acq_distribution_formulas]]
== Distribution Formulas ==

indexterm:[acquisitions,distribution formulas, templates]

Distribution formulas allow you to specify the number of copies that should be
distributed to specific branches. They can also serve as templates allowing you
to predefine settings for your copies. You can create and reuse formulas as
needed.

=== Create a distribution formula ===

. Go to _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Distribution Formulas_.

. Click _New Distribution Formula_.

. Enter a Formula Name. No limits exist on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.

. Choose a Formula Owner from the drop-down menu. The Formula Owner indicates the organizational units whose staff can use this formula. TThe drop-down menu is controlled by permissions and you will see a list of org units that your user account has permission to create distribution formulas for.
.

[[acq_edi]]
== Electronic Data Interchange ==
indexterm:[acquisitions,EDI,accounts]
indexterm:[EDI,accounts]

Many libraries use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) accounts to send purchase orders and receive invoices
 from providers electronically.  In Evergreen users can setup EDI accounts and manage EDI messages in 
 the admin module.  EDI messages and notes can be viewed in the acquisitions module. See
also the command line system administration manual, which includes some initial setup steps that are
required for use of EDI.

=== Entering SANs (Standard Address Numbers) ===

For EDI to work your library must have a SAN and each of your providers must each supply you with their SAN.

A SAN (Standard Address Number) is a unique 7 digit number that identifies your library.  

==== Entering a Library's SAN ====

These steps only need to be done once per library.

. In Evergreen select _Administration_ -> _Server Administration_ -> _Organizational Units_ 
. Find your library in the tree on the left side of the page and click on it to open the settings.
+
[NOTE]
Multi-branch library systems will see an entry for each branch but should select their system's
top organization unit.
+
. Click on the _Address_ tab.
. Click on the _Mailing Address_ tab.
. Enter your library's SAN in the field labeled _SAN_.
. Click _Save_.

image::acq_funds/library_san_angular.png[Enter Library SAN]


==== Entering a Provider's SAN ====

These steps need to be repeated for every provider with which EDI is used.

. In Evergreen select _Administration_ -> _Acquisitions Administration_ -> _Providers_.
. Double click in the grid line of the provider you would like to edit.
+
image::acq_funds/provider_san_ang_1.png[Enter Provider SAN]

. Scroll down to see the field labeled _SAN_ and enter your provider's SAN.
. Click _Save_.
+
image::acq_funds/provider_san_ang_2.png[Enter Provider SAN]

=== Create an EDI Account ===

CAUTION: You *must* create your provider before you create an EDI account for the provider.

. Contact your provider requesting the following information:
* Host
* Username
* Password
* Path
* Incoming Directory
* Provider's SAN
* Account, Account Number, and Assigned Code if your Provider uses that information.

. In Evergreen select _Administration_ -> _Acquisitions Administration_ -> _EDI Accounts_.
. Click _New EDI Account_. A pop-up will appear.
+
image::acq_funds/new_edi_account_ang.png[Create EDI Account]

. Fill in the following fields:
* In the _Label_ field, enter a name for the EDI account. This field is required.
* In the _Provider_ field, select the Provider code from the dropdown. This field is required.
* In the _Owner_ field, select the owning Organizational Unit from the dropdown. Multi-branch libraries should select their top level organizational unit.
* In the _Account_ field, enter information supplied by your provider.
* In the _Vendor Account Number_ field, enter information supplied by your provider.
* In the _Vendor Assigned Code_ field, enter information supplied by your provider.
* The _Last Activity_ updates automatically with any inbound or outbound communication.
* In the _Host_ field, enter the requisite FTP or SCP information supplied by
your provider. Be sure to include the protocol (e.g. `ftp://ftp.vendorname.com`)
* In the _Username_ field, enter the username supplied by your provider.
* In the _Password_ field, enter the password supplied by your provider.
* In the _Path_ field, enter the path supplied by your provider. The path indicates a directory on the provider's server where Evergreen will deposit its outgoing order files.
+
[TIP]
If your vendor requests a specific file extension for EDI purchase orders,
such as `.ord`, enter the name of the directory, followed by a slash,
followed by an asterisk, followed by a period, followed by the extension.
For example, if the vendor requests that EDI purchase orders be sent to
a directory called `in` with the file extension `.ord`, your path would
be `in/*.ord`.
+
* In the _Incoming Directory_ field, enter the incoming directory supplied by your provider. This indicates the directory on the vendor’s server where Evergreen will retrieve incoming order responses and invoices.
+
[NOTE]
Don't worry if your incoming directory is named `out` or `outgoing`.
From your vendor's perspective, this directory is outgoing, because
it contains files that the vendor is sending to Evergreen.  However,
from Evergreen's perspective, these files are incoming.
+
* If your Provider requires the use of an Attributes set, check the box next to _Use EDI Attributes_ and select the correct Attributes set from the _EDI Attributes Set_ dropdown. 
image::acq_funds/new_edi_account_ang_2.png[Create EDI Account]
 
. Click _Save_.

[NOTE] If there are multiple EDI Accounts for your Provider, you may want to set a EDI Default, which can be done from the Provider interface.

=== EDI Attribute Sets ===

EDI Attribute Sets define the information that is sent to a vendor in EDI messages. Evergreen currently has stock EDI Attribute Sets for use with several materials vendors:

* Baker & Taylor Default
* Brodart Default
* Ingram Default
* Midwest Library Service
* Midwest Tape Default
* Recorded Books Default
* ULS Default

These stock EDI Attribute Sets can be modified depending on EDI configuration needs and customized EDI Attribute Sets can also be created. 

EDI Attribute Sets are linked to EDI Accounts in _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> EDI Accounts_.

[[acq_fund_admin]]
== Fund Administration ==

indexterm:[acquisitions,funds]

Fund Administration provides a unified interface for configuring your funding sources, purchasing funds, and optional fund tags. To access Fund Administration, go to _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Fund Administration_. This interface has three tabs: Funds, Funding Sources, and Fund Tags. Negative numbers in these interfaces are styled in red.

image::acq_funds/funds1.PNG[Fund Administration]

=== Funding Sources ===

indexterm:[acquisitions,funding sources]

Funding sources allow you to specify the sources that contribute monies to your fund(s). You can create as few or as many funding sources as you need. These can be used to track exact amounts for accounts in your general ledger. You can then use funds to track spending and purchases for specific collections.

Examples of funding sources are:

* A municipal allocation for your materials budget;
* A trust fund used for collections;
* A revolving account that is used to replace lost materials;
* Grant funds to be used for collections.

==== Create a funding source ====

=== Funds ===

indexterm:[acquisitions,funds]

Funds allow you to allocate credits toward specific purchases. They typically are used to track spending and purchases for specific collections. Some libraries may choose to define very broad funds for their collections (e.g. children's materials, adult materials) while others may choose to define more specific funds (e.g. adult non-fiction DVDs for BR1).

If your library does not wish to track fund accounting, you can create one large generic fund and use that fund for all of your purchases.

In the funds interface, you can create funds; allocate credits from funding sources to funds; transfer money between funds; and apply fund tags to funds.

Funds are created for a specific year, either fiscal or calendar, and are owned by an org unit or library. At the top of the funds interface, you can set a contextual org unit or library to view the associated funds. Within the grid display of funds you can filter by year to view the funds for a specific year only.

The Funds tab will give you a general overview of the configuration and status of your funds.

==== Create a fund ====

To create a new Fund:

. Go to _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Fund Administration_.
. Go to the _Funds_ tab and click the _New Fund_ button.
. Enter a Name for the fund. No limits exist on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Create a Code for the fund. No limits exist on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Enter a Year for the fund. This can be a fiscal year or a calendar year. The format of the year is YYYY. The year entry is restricted to a range of 10 years before through 10 years after the current year.
. Select an Org Unit from the drop-down menu. The org unit indicates the organizational units whose staff can use this fund. This menu is populated with the Short (Policy) Name codes that you created for your libraries in the organizational units tree (See Administration -> Server Administration -> Organizational Units).
. Check the Active box to make this an active fund. You cannot make purchases from this fund if it is not active.
. Select a Currency Type from the drop-down menu. This menu consists of entries Currencies and Exchange Rates interface. When a fund is applied to a line item or copy, the price of the item will be encumbered in the currency associated with the fund.
. Check the Propagate box if you want to propagate funds during fiscal year close out procedures.
.. When you propagate a fund, the ILS will create a new fund for the following fiscal year with the same parameters as your current fund. All of the settings transfer except for the year and the amount of money in the fund. Propagation occurs during the fiscal year close out operation.
. Check the Rollover box if you want to roll over remaining funds into an equivalent fund during the next year.
.. You should also check this box if you only want to roll over encumbrances into next year’s fund. Rollover occurs during the fiscal year close out operation.
. Enter a Balance Stop Percent.
.. The balance stop percent prevents you from making purchases when only a specified amount of the fund remains. For example, if you want to spend 95 percent of your funds, leaving a five percent balance in the fund, then you would enter 95 in the field. When the fund reaches its balance stop percent, it will appear in red when you apply funds to copies.
. Enter a Balance Warning Percent.
.. The balance warning percent gives you a warning that the fund is low. You can specify any percent. For example, if you want to spend 90 percent of your funds and be warned when the fund has only 10 percent of its balance remaining, then enter 90 in the field. When the fund reaches its balance warning percent, it will appear in yellow when you apply funds to copies.
.  Click _Save_.

image::acq_funds/funds2.PNG[Create a New Fund]

==== Track balances and expenditures ====

The Fund Details Summary tab allows you to track a fund’s balance, encumbrances, and amount spent. It also allows you to track allocations from the funding source(s), debits, and fund tags.

To access the fund details, click on the hyperlinked name of the fund that you created.

The Summary allows you to track the following:
* Combined Balance - The balance is calculated by subtracting both items that have been invoiced and encumbrances from the total allocated to the fund.
* Allocation Total - This amount is the total amount allocated from the Funding Source.
* Spent Balance - This balance is calculated by subtracting only the items that have been invoiced from the total allocated to the fund. It does not include encumbrances.
* Debit Total - The total debits are calculated by adding the cost of items that have been invoiced and encumbrances.
* Spent Total - The total spent is calculated by adding the cost of items that have been invoiced. It does not include encumbrances.
*Encumbrance Total - The total encumbered is calculated by adding all encumbrances.

image::acq_funds/funds3.PNG[Fund Details Summary]

From this interface, you can also Transfer Money between Funds and Create an Allocation to a Fund from a Funding Source.

==== Allocate credits from funding sources to funds ====

Credits can be applied to funds from funding sources. The credits that you apply to the fund can be applied later to line items on purchase orders.

. When viewing the Fund Details of a specific fund, click on _Create Allocation_.
. Choose a Funding Source from the drop-down menu.
. Enter an Amount that you want to apply to the fund from the funding source.
. Enter a Note. This field is optional.
. Click _Save_.
. The amount specified will be moved from the Funding Source to the Fund and you will see this reflected in the Allocation Total in the Fund Details Summary tab and in the Allocations tab.

image::acq_funds/allocate_to_fund_ang.png[Allocate to Fund]

==== Transfer money between funds ====

The money that you allocate to funds can be transferred between funds if desired. In the following example, you can transfer $500.00 from the Adult Fiction fund to the Juvenile fund.

. The amount specified will be moved between the Funds and you will see this reflected in the Allocation Total in the Fund Details Summary tab and in the Transfers tab.

image::acq_funds/transfer_funds_ang.png[Transfer Funds]

NOTE: If the source fund has allocations from multiple funding sources, the fund transfer function will sometimes split the transfer allocation between the funding sources.

==== Perform fiscal year close out operation

The Fiscal Propagation and Rollover operation allows you to deactivate funds for the current year and create analogous funds for the next year. It transfers encumbrances to the analogous funds, and it rolls over any remaining funds if you checked the rollover box when creating the fund.

image::acq_funds/propagate_rollover_ang.png[Propagate and Rollover]

To perform the year end closeout of funds:

. Go to _Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Fund Administration_.
. Review your current funds.
.. Confirm that the correct Org Unit is selected.
.. Double check the Year Filter.  It defaults to the current year, so you may need to switch back to a previous year to view funds that have not been rolled over yet.  If the list is blank, check this.
.. Double check that the correct funds have Propagate and Rollover set. 
. Click _Fiscal Propagation and Rollover_.
. Verify the Context Org Unit for the close out operation.
. Select the Year that you want to close out.
. Include funds from descendant Org Units: check this box if you want to include funds owned by descendant org units of the Context Org Unit.
. Fund Propagation: This will happen automatically when _Process_ is clicked, if the Fund’s Propagate setting is enabled.
. Perform Fiscal Year Close-Out: check this box to move encumbrances and unspent funds to the analogous fund for the next fiscal year. It will also deactivate funds for the selected fiscal year. Evergreen will only move encumbrances and unspent funds if the Rollover setting is enabled for a fund.
.. Limit Fiscal Year Close-Out to Encumbrances: check this box if only encumbered funds should be moved to the analogous fund for the next fiscal year. Unspent funds will not be carried forward to the next fiscal year. This setting will only display if the ‘Allow funds to be rolled over without bringing the money along’ Library Setting has been enabled. This setting is available in the Library Setting Editor accessible via Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor.
. Dry Run: check this box if you want to test changes to the funds before they are enacted. Evergreen will generate a summary of the changes that would occur during the selected operations. No data will be changed.
. Click _Process_.
. Evergreen will begin the propagation process. Evergreen will make a clone of each fund, but it will increment the year by 1.

image::acq_funds/acq_fy_closeout.png[Fiscal Year Closeout]


=== Fund Tags ===

You can apply tags to funds so that you can group funds for easy reporting. For example, you have three funds for children’s materials: Children’s Board Books, Children’s DVDs, and Children’s CDs. Assign a fund tag of 'children’s' to each fund. When you need to report on the amount that has been spent on all children’s materials, you can run a report on the fund tag to find total expenditures on children’s materials rather than reporting on each individual fund.

==== Create a Fund Tag ====

[[acq_display_improvements]]
=== Display Improvements ===

As part of transitioning the General Search interface to Angular, several changes have been made to improve the display and usability of the module:

. Fields that are associated with controlled vocabularies will display the controlled values in both the search terms and filters for easy selection. These fields include:
.. Owner
.. Active
.. Prepayment Required
. Column headers for the search results can be clicked on to sort the results by the column. The columns will sort alphabetically or by date as appropriate for the data type.
. Using the column actions to filter or sort search results will execute a new search using the original search parameters. If any un-executed changes are made to the search parameters between the initial search submission and any changes to the filters, the new search parameters will be executed upon filtering.
. Dropdown menus for the search fields will retrieve a maximum of 100 rows at a time.
