== Authority Control Sets ==


The tags and subfields that display in authority records in Evergreen are
proscribed by control sets.  The Library of Congress control set is the default
control set in Evergreen.  You can create customized
control sets for authority records.  Also, you can define thesauri and authority
fields for these control sets.

Patrons and staff will be able to browse authorities in the OPAC.  The following
fields are browsable by default: author, series, subject, title, and topic.  You
will be able to add custom browse axes in addition to these default fields.

You can specify the MARC tags and subfields that an authority record should
contain.  The Library of Congress control set exists in the staff client by
default.  The control sets feature enables librarians to add or customize new
control sets.

To access existing control sets, click *Administration* -> *Server Administration* -> 
*Authority Control Sets*.

== Thesauri ==

A thesaurus describes the semantic rules that govern the meaning of words in a
MARC record. The thesaurus code, which indicates the specific thesaurus that
should control a MARC record, is encoded in a fixed field using the mnemonic
Subj in the authority record.  Eleven thesauri associated with the Library of
Congress control set exist by default in the staff client.  

To access an existing thesaurus, click *Administration* -> *Server Administration* -> 
*Authority Control Sets*, and choose the hyperlinked thesaurus that you

== Authority Fields ==


Authority fields indicate the tags and subfields that should be entered in the
authority record.  Authority fields also enable you to specify the type of data
that should be entered in a tag.  For example, in an authority record governed
by a Library of Congress control set, the 100 tag would contain a "Heading -
Personal Name."  Authority fields also enable you to create the corresponding
tag in the bibliographic record that would contain the same data. 

=== Create an Authority Field ===

. Click *Administration* -> *Server Administration* ->  *Authority Control Sets*.
. Click *Controlling Authority Fields*. 
. Click *New Authority Control Set Authority Field*.
. Choose a *Control Set* from the dropdown box.
. Add a *Description* to describe the type of data that should be entered in this tag. Enter any number of characters.
. Choose an option from the *Heading Field* dropdown box to indicate the type of heading for the fieldâ€™s content to specify the form of name, 
title, or term.  
. Add a specific *Joiner*, if desired, to indicate the string to be used to combine components of the heading into a single display string. 
If not set, " --" is used.
. Add a *Linking Subfield* if needed.
. Select a *Main Entry* if you are linking the tag(s) to another entry.
. Add a *Name* to the authority field. Enter any number of characters.
. Add a *Non-filing indicator* (either 1 or 2) to denote which indicator contains non-filing information. Leave empty if not applicable.
