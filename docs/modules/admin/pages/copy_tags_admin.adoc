Item Tags allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags to items.  Item tags are visible in the public catalog and are searchable in both the staff client and public catalog based on configuration.  This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to attach donation or memorial information to items, but may be used for broader purposes to tag items.

== Creating item Tags ==
There are two components to this feature: Item Tag Types and Item Tags.

Item Tag Types are used to define the type of tag, such as “Bookplates” or “Local History Notes”, as well as the organizational unit scope for use of the tag type.

Item Tags are associated with a Item Tag Type and are used to configure the list of tags that can be applied to copies, such as a list of memorial or donation labels, that are applicable to a particular organizational unit.

. Go to *Administration->Server Administration->Item Tag Types*.
. In the upper left hand corner, click *New Record*.  A dialog box will appear.  Assign the following to create a new Item Tag Type:
