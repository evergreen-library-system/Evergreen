indexterm:[address alerts]

The Address Alert module gives administrators the ability to notify staff with a custom message when 
addresses with certain patterns are entered in patron records. 

This feature only serves to provide pertinent information to your library system's circulation staff during the registration process. An alert will not prevent the new patron account from being registered, and the information will not be permanently associated with the patron account.

To access the Address Alert module, select *Administration* -> *Local Administration* -> *Address Alerts*.

[NOTE]
==========
You must have Local Administrator permissions or the ADMIN_ADDRESS_ALERT permission to access the Address Alert module.
==========

== General Usage Examples ==

- Alert staff when an address for a large apartment is entered to prompt them to ask for a unit number.
- Alert staff when the address of a hotel or other temporary housing is entered.
- Alert staff when an address for a different country is entered.
- Alert staff when a specific city or zip code is entered if that city or zip code needs to be handled in a special way. If you have a neighboring city that you don't have a reciprocal relationship with, you could notify staff that a fee card is required for this customer.

== Access Control and Scoping ==

Each address alert is tied to an organizational unit and will only be matched against staff client instances of that organizational unit and its children.

When viewing the address alerts, you will only see the alerts associated with the specific organizational unit selected in the context selection box. You won't see alerts associated with parent organizational units, so the list of alerts isn't a list of all alerts that may affect your organizational unit, only of the ones that you can edit.

== Adding a New Address Alert ==

How to add an address to the alert list:

. Log into the Evergreen Staff Client using a Local Administrator account or another account that has been granted the proper permission.
. Click on *Administration* -> *Local Administration* -> *Address Alerts*.
. Click *New Address Alert*.
. A form will open with the following fields to fill out:
+
.New Address Alert Fields 
|===
|*Field*               |*Description*
| Owner                |Which organizational unit owns this alert. Set this to your system or branch.
| Alert Message        |Message that will be displayed to staff when this alert is triggered.

| Active               |Check-box that controls if the alert is active or not. Inactive alerts are not processed.
| Address Alert ID     |Displays the internal database id for alert after the alert has been saved. This auto-populates.
|===

. Click *Save* once you have finished.

== Editing an Address Alert ==

To make changes to an existing alert, double click on the alert in the list. The editing form will appear. Make your changes and click *Save* (or *Cancel* to exit the form and cancel the action) when you are done.

If you don't see your alerts, make sure the organizational unit in the context box has the correct organizational unit selected.

== Staff View of Address Alerts ==

When an Address Alert is triggered by a matching address, staff will see the address block highlighted with a red dashed line, along with an *Address Alert* block which contains the alert message.

Here is an example of what staff would see.

== Regular Expressions / Wildcards ==

All of the patterns entered to match the various address fields are evaluated as case-insensitive regular expressions by default.

[NOTE]
==========
Address Alerts use POSIX Regular Expressions included in the PostgreSQL database engine. See the PostgreSQL documentation for full details. 
==========

If you want to do a case-sensitive match you need to prepend the pattern with "(?c)"

The simplest regular expression that acts as a wildcard is ".*", that matches any type of character zero or more times.

== Examples ==

.Apartment address
Match an apartment address to prompt for unit number.

. Choose *Owner* organizational unit
. Active = Checked
. Match All Fields = Checked
. Alert Message = "This is a large apartment building. Please ask customer for unit number."
. Street (1) = "1212 Evergreen Lane.*"
. City = "mytown"

.All addresses on street
Match all addresses on a certain street. Matches ave and avenue because of ending wildcard.

. Choose *Owner* organizational unit
. Active = Checked
. Match All Fields = Checked
. Alert Message = "This street is in a different county, please setup reciprocal card."
. Street (1) = ".* Evergreen Ave.*"
. City = "mytown"

.Match list of cities
Match several different cities with one alert. Could be used if certain cities don't have reciprocal agreements. Note the use of parentheses and the | character to separate the different options. 

. Choose *Owner* organizational unit
. Active = Checked
. Match All Fields = Checked
. Alert Message = "Customer must purchase a Fee card."
. City = "(Emeryville|San Jose|San Francisco)"
