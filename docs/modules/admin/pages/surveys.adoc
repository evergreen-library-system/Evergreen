indexterm:[Surveys]

Surveys can be created that appear on the patron registration/edit page for a branch or system. Survey questions can be optional or required. Some examples of survey questions might include: Would you use the library if it were open on a Sunday? Would you like to be contacted by the library to learn about new services? Do you attend library programs? Are you registered to vote?

Surveys come up when a patron is first registered. If you would like staff to ask the survey questions when the patron’s library card is renewed, you’ll need to make that part of local procedure.

It is possible to run reports on surveys, which allows you to obtain statistical information. For example, you could find out how many people say they would use the library if it were open on a Sunday, or you could get a list of patrons who say they would like to receive marketing material from the library. You can also visit individual patron records to see their survey answers.

== Reporting on Surveys ==

There are three Non-core Sources for reporting.

* *Survey*
** This reports information about surveys starting with the Survey.
** This source is great to see the surveys with questions and answers(Responses). 
** Also, use this source to find out the Survey Answers and Questions ID's.
* *Survey Answer*
** This source starts with the answers then goes to the questions.
* *Survey Response*
** This source ties into the Responding Users.  
** Use this source to report user information and counts.
** This is the source you will use for most of the reporting on Surveys.

In the Core Sources, you can use _ILS User_. In the ILS User, there is the source for _Survey Responses_.

NOTE: In the _Survey Response_ source, there is a _Response Group ID_. This links all the answers to a specific set of Survey questions, answers, and patron information.
