indexterm:[Surveys]

Surveys can be created that appear on the patron registration/edit page for a branch or system. Surveys questions can be optional or required. Some examples of survey questions might include: Would you use the library if it were open on a Sunday? Would you like to be contacted by the library to learn about new services? Do you attend library programs? Are you registered to vote?

Surveys come up when a patron is first registered. If you would like staff to ask the survey questions when the patron’s library card is renewed, you’ll need to make that part of local procedure.

It is possible to run reports on Surveys, this will allow you to obtain statisical information from the surveys or listing of responses. For example, you could find out how many people say they would use the library if it were open on a Sunday, or you could get a list of patrons who say they would like to receive marketing material from the library. You can also visit individvual patron records to see their survey answers.
