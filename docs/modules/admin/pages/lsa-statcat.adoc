= Statistical Categories Editors =
:toc:

The Statistical Categories Editors are split into two interfaces, one for items and one for patrons, and are where you configure your statistical categories (stat cats). Stat cats are a way to save and report on additional information that doesn't fit elsewhere in Evergreen's default records.

An organizational unit (consortium, library system branch library, sub library, etc.) may create their own categories and entries, or supplement categories defined by a higher-level org unit with their own entries.

== Item Statistical Categories ==

Item stat cats appear in the _Holdings Editor_. You might use item stat cats to track books you have bought from a specific vendor, or donations.

=== Creating an Item Stat Cat ===

To create a new item stat cat,

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Statistical Categories Editor - Item*.

. Click *New Statistical Category Editor - Item*.

* _Owning Library_: Select the library for which the stat cat applies.
* _Required_: Select this option if the category must be assigned a value when editing the item attributes.

== Patron Statistical Categories ==

Patron stat cats can be used to keep track of information such as a patron's school affiliation, membership in a group like the Friends of the Library, or patron preferences. They appear in the fourth section of the _Patron Registration_ or _Edit Patron_ screen, under the label _Statistical Categories_. Managing patron stat cats involves the same process as item stat cats, with a few slight differences.
