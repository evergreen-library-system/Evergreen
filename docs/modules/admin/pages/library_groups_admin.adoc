= Library Groups Administration

indexterm:[Library Groups,Searching]

The xref:opac:using_the_public_access_catalog.adoc#library_groups[Library Groups] search feature revives a longstanding internal concept in Evergreen called “Lassos,” which allows an administrator to define a group of organizational units for searching outside of the standard organizational unit hierarchy.

Use case examples include creating a group of law or science libraries
within a university consortium, or grouping all school libraries
together within a mixed school/public library.

== Creating a new Library Group

To create a new Library Group, you must have the ADMIN_LIBRARY_GROUPS
permission. This permission will need to be assigned as needed to staff
accounts and/or permission groups by an administrator. No permission
groups will have this permission by default.

Navigate to *Administration -> Server Administration* and select *Library
Groups*.

Select *New Library Group*.

Name your Library Group.

[NOTE]
==== 
If you want the Library Group to be visible at all locations,
check the *Global* checkbox. By default this is unchecked and therefore
the Library Group will be visible only at locations that belong to the
Library Group.

Global Library Groups should only be used in Consortia using catalogs
WITHOUT a locg parameter or its equivalent (org hiding, separate
hostnames) to start at a particular context location.

Consortia that allow all users to search all locations should, as a
matter of best practice, make all Library Groups global.
====

When you are finished, click *Save*.

Return to *Server Administration* and select *Library Group Maps*.

. Select *New Library Group Map*.

. Click *Save*.

Repeat steps 1-4 until all desired Organizational Units are assigned to
the Library Group.

[NOTE]
====
Descendant Organizational Units are NOT automatically included
and each must be specifically added to the Library Group.

After all Library Groups are created and assigned, it is recommended (but not required) that you run autogen and restart Apache.
