== Copy Editor: Copy Location Name First ==

indexterm:[copy editor, shelving location]

By default, when editing item records, library code is displayed in front of
shelving location in _Shelving Location_ field. You may reverse the order by going
to *Administration -> Workstation Administration ->  Copy Editor: Copy Location Name
First*.
Simply click it to make copy location name displayed first. The setting is saved
on the workstation. 

== Font and Sound Settings ==

indexterm:[staff client, fonts, zooming]
indexterm:[staff client, sounds]

=== In the Staff Client ===

You may change the size of displayed text or turn staff client sounds on
and off. These settings are specific to each workstation and stored on
local hard disk. They do not affect OPAC font sizes.

. Select *Administration -> Workstation Administration ->   Global Font and Sound
Settings*.
. To turn off the system sounds, like the noise that happens when a patron
with a block is retrieved, check the _disable sound_ box and click _Save
to Disk_.

. To change the size of the font, pick the desired option and click _Save
to Disk_.

=== In the OPAC ===

It is also possible to zoom in and zoom out when viewing the OPAC in the
staff client, making the font appear larger or smaller. (This will not
affect other screens.) Use *CTRL + +* (plus sign, to zoom in), *CTRL + -*
(minus sign, to zoom out), and *CTRL + 0* (to restore default). The
workstation will remember the setting.

== Select Hotkeys ==

indexterm:[staff client, hotkeys]

All or partial hotkeys can be turned on or off. It can be done for a particular 
workstation: 

. Navigate to *Administration -> Workstation Administration ->   Hotkeys -> Current*. 
. Select _Default_, _Minimal_, and _None_.
+

+  
* *Default*: including all hotkeys
* *Minimal*: including those hotkeys using CTRL key
* *None*: excluding all hotkeys
+
. Go back to the above menu. 
. Click *Set Workstation Default to Current*. 

To clear the existing default click *Clear Workstation Default*.

You can use the *Toggle Hotkeys* button, included in some toolbars, on top right
corner, to switch your selected Hotkeys  _on_ or
_off_ for the current login session.
It has the same effect as when you click *Disable Hotkeys* on the _Hotkeys_ menu.

== Configure Printers ==

indexterm:[staff client, printers]

Use the Printer Settings Editor to configure printer output for each
workstation. If left unconfigured Evergreen will use the default printer set in
the workstation's operating system (Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, etc).

Evergreen printing works best if you are using recent, hardware-specific printer
drivers.

. Select *Administration -> Workstation Administration ->  Printer Settings Editor*.
. Select the _Printer Context_. At a minimum set the _Default_ context on each
Evergreen workstation. Repeat the procedure for other contexts if they differ
from the default (e.g. if spine labels should output to a different printer.
+

+
* *Default*: Default settings for staff client print functions (set for each
workstation). 
* *Receipt*: Settings for printing receipts.
* *Label*: Printer settings for spine and pocket labels.
* *Mail*: Settings for printing mailed notices (not yet active).
* *Offline*: Applies to all printing from the Offline Interface.
+
. After choosing _Printer Context_ click *Set Default Printer* and *Print Test
Page* and follow the prompts. If successful, test output will print to your chosen
printer. 
+

adjust settings. When finished click *OK* and print another test page to view
changes.

=== Advanced Settings ===

If you followed the steps above and still cannot print there are two alternate
print strategies: 

* DOS LPTI Print (sends unformatted text directly to the parallel port)
* Custom/External Print (configuration required)

[NOTE]
====================================
Evergreen cannot print using the Windows Generic/Text Only driver. If this
driver is the only one available try one of the alternate print strategies
instead.
