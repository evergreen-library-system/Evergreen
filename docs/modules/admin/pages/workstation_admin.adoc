== Workstation Permissions/User Settings ==

=== Browser Client Settings & Preferences Stored on the Server ===

As of Evergreen 3.2, a permission has been added to allow which accounts can apply values to workstation settings. Ultimately, this will prevent users from having to reset their settings everytime they register a new workstation.  This can especially be helpful post-system upgrade so workstation settings can be restored and applied automatically.

Here is the workstation script to add the permission manually:
----
INSERT INTO permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree WHERE name = 'Staff'), -- name may vary
    (SELECT id FROM permission.perm_list WHERE code =
'APPLY_WORKSTATION_SETTING'),
    0 -- or 1, 2, etc.
);
---- 

What this will do is create a workstation setting that will also match with what was previously stored in the browser either by localStorage or by Hatch.

== Include Full Library Names in Library Selector? ==

This checkbox will allow users to view the full library name instead of the shortcode in certain screens within Evergreen.  This isn't available for all pages, but some dropdown menus.
