indexterm:[Global Flags]

Evergreen uses Global Flags to set certain elements that are global across an Evergreen instance. Unlike Library Settings, Global Flags cannot hold different values for different libraries.

The Global Flags interface is found under *Administration -> Server Administration -> Global Flags*.

The table below is sorted in alphabetical order according to the _Name_ column. The _Other Information_ column contains links to a bug, release notes, commit message, or documentation, as applicable for that particular global flag.

|auth.block_expired_staff_login |Block the ability of expired user with the STAFF_LOGIN permission to log into Evergreen.|No| |If this flag is enabled, accounts that have the STAFF_LOGIN permission and whose expiration date is in the past are prevented from logging into any Evergreen interface, including the staff client, the public catalog, and SIP2. Regular non-staff patrons are allowed to log into the public catalog with expired accounts.|https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1474029[bug 1474029]
|cat.bib.use_id_for_tcn |Cat: Use Internal ID for TCN Value|Yes| |Matches the bibliographic record's TCN to its Evergreen database ID|

|circ.desk_renewal.use_original_circ_lib|Circ: Use original circulation library on desk renewal instead of the workstation library|No | |Left disabled, the workstation library's circulation/renewal policy will be used, rather than the user's home/original library circulation/renewal policy during a staff client (desk) renewal. By default, a desk renewal looks at the policies of the workstation library performing the renewal.|
|circ.holds.empty_issuance_ok|Holds: Allow holds on empty issuances|Yes | |Holds on predicted but not-yet received items|
|circ.holds.retarget_interval|Holds Retarget Interval|Yes|24h| |https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1596595[bug 1596595]
|circ.holds.usr_not_requestor|Holds: When testing hold matrix matchpoints, use the profile group of the receiving user instead of that of the requestor (affects staff-placed holds)|Yes | |  |https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1473576[bug 1473576]
|circ.opac_renewal.use_original_circ_lib|Circ: Use original circulation library on opac renewal instead of user home library |No | |Left disabled, the user's home library circulation/renewal policy will be used, rather than the original circulation library's circulation/renewal policy during an OPAC renewal. By default, an OPAC renewal looks at the policies of the user's home library. |
|history.circ.retention_age|Historical Circulation Retention Age|Yes| |Determines the timeframe for aging circulations based on transaction age. If you want your users to be able to retain their circulation history and view it in the OPAC, then click True, and set a global maximum. The maximum is a length of time entered in double quotes, such as "1 year". Beginning the day that you set it and each day for a year forward in time, the circs will be saved. This setting is the default for your entire network. If you don’t want patrons to be able to retain their circulation history, then set this to false. If value is not set, it will default to forever. Note: if you scope in the value of aged circulations they still exist just anonymized. There isn't a feature to delete circs at any point, you'd have to go in and do it with a custom script.|xref:admin:aged_circs.adoc#_global_flags[Aging Circulations]
|history.circ.retention_age_is_min|Historical Circulations are kept for global retention age at a minimum, regardless of user preferences.|No| |This flag is no longer useful, since user circ history no longer needs to prevent circs from being aged to be complete. |xref:admin:aged_circs.adoc#_global_flags[Aging Circulations]
|history.circ.retention_count|Historical Circulations per Copy|Yes| |This flag is about aging circs to anonymize them.|xref:admin:aged_circs.adoc#_global_flags[Aging Circulations]
|history.circ.retention_uses_last_finished|Historical Circulations use most recent xact_finish date instead of last circ's.|No| |This flag is about aging circs to anonymize them.|xref:admin:aged_circs.adoc#_global_flags[Aging Circulations]
|history.hold.retention_age|Historical Hold Retention Age|Yes||Determines the timeframe to retain holds information. Purged holds are moved to the action.aged_hold_request table with patron identifyinginformation scrubbed, much like circulations are moved to action.aged_circulation. The settings allow for a default retention age as well as distinct retention ages for holds filled, holds canceled, and holds canceled by specific cancel causes. The most specific one wins unless a patron is retaining their hold history. In the latter case the patron’s holds are retained either way. Note that the function still needs to be called, which could be set up as a cron job or done more manually, say after statistics collection. Script, purge_holds.srfsh, can be used to purge holds from cron.|https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.5/_administration.html[Release Notes] - located under "Purge Holds"

This feature requires a 3rd party geographic location service in order to function. If you are using your own geographic location service, then this flag must be enabled in order for proximity sort to work.
