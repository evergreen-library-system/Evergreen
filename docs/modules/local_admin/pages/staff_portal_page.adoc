= Staff Portal Page =
:toc:

Beginning in version 3.9, there is a Local Administration interface allowing a staff user with appropriate permissions to customize the staff portal (AKA homepage; AKA landing page) - hereinafter ‘portal page’ - that displays to staff when they log in to the Evergreen staff client. This work only affects the Angular implementation of the portal page.

Different portal pages may be configured for different Organizational
Units. The displayed portal page will depend on the staff user's
workstation. The Organizational Unit tree will be walked up starting
from the workstation until one or more config.ui_staff_splash_page_entry
rows are found for the Organizational Unit. The set of entries for that
Organizational Unit will constitute the entire splash page entries to
display, i.e., it won't try to merge branch, system, and
consortial-level entries.

== New Tables ==

Homepage contents are stored in the new table
`config.ui_staff_splash_page_entry` which contains the following columns:

* id SERIAL
* column tinyint (numeric column value, e.g., 1, 2, 3)
* pos (position of entry in each column. pos = 0 will be magic: its label
will be displayed as the column header)
* entry_type enum (link, menuitem, context, catalogsearch)
* label text (label to display for the entry). This will be marked for
i18n.
* image text (relative URL of an image to display to the left of the
column label)
* link text (URL for link and menuitem type rows; the label will be the
link text)
* text text (value of the text type. HTML will be stripped. Text entries
will display the label (if present) as a title followed by the contents
of the text box). This will be marked for i18n.
* org_unit (owner of the entries)

The new table `config.ui_staff_splash_page_entry_type` is a lookup table
for entry types.

== Permissions ==

A new permission, `ADMIN_STAFF_SPLASH_PAGE`, will be added to control
access to adding, modifying, and deleting `config.ui_splash_page_entry`
rows via PCRUD. The new permission will be included in the stock Local
Administrator profile.

The existing STAFF_LOGIN permission will be used to gate read access to
`config.ui_splash_page_entry`.

== Staff Portal Customization Interface ==

The interface to customize the portal page can be found at
*Administration → Local Administration → Staff Portal Page*
(/eg2/en-US/staff/admin/local/config/ui_staff_portal_page_entry). Access
to this interface is controlled by a new permission,
ADMIN_STAFF_PORTAL_PAGE, which by default is assigned to the Local
Administrator Permission Group via the EVERYTHING permission at System
depth.

The interface shows a grid of Portal Page Entries and by default will
scope to show just entries at the workstation organizational unit. You
can use the library selector at the top left to change which
organizational units are displayed.

Actions from this interface:

* *New Portal Page Entry* (button) - this will open a modal with a blank
portal page entry form. The new entry’s owner will default to the
workstation organizational unit.
* *Clone a Library’s Portal Page Entries* (button) - this will clone the
entire set of entries from one library to another library. If you want
the cloned entries to replace any existing entries at the target
library, check the checkbox _Clear Entries at Target Library?_ After you
clone a set of entries, the grid will refresh and automatically change
the library selector to the target library.
* *Delete Selected* (right click or action menu) - this will delete all
selected portal entry items
* *Edit Selected* (right click, action menu, or double click) - this will
open an edit modal for the selected line

=== Portal Page Entry Modal ===

This is the modal that will display when you add a new portal page entry
or edit an existing portal page entry. This modal has the following
fields:

* _Entry Label_ - this is a free text label which will display differently
on the portal page depending on what Entry Type is used.
* _Entry Type_ (required) - this is a dropdown which indicates which type
of entry is being configured. Each Entry Type has specific display
styling and function, as well as impacting how the Entry Label will
display.
** _Catalog Search Box_: this will create a basic Evergreen search box.
When Catalog Search is selected, the Entry Label text will display in
the Search button.
** _Header_: this will create a column header. It should only be used in
Column Position 0 (i.e. the top “row” of a column). The Entry Label text
will display as the Header text.
** _Link_: this will create a link to an external URL or a mailto URI. The
Entry Label text will display as hyperlinked text pointing to the URL
specified in Entry Target URL.
** _Menu Item_: this will create a link to an internal Evergreen Staff
Client page. The Entry Label text will display as hyperlinked text
pointing to the internal Evergreen link specified in Entry Target URL.
** _Text and/or HTML_: this will create a short piece of either plain text
or marked up text. See below for a list of acceptable markup. The Entry
Label text will show as a non-hyperlinked heading above any text or HTML
entered in Entry Text. Entry Label can be blank for this Entry Type, if
you choose.
* _Entry Target URL_ - this is a text field to specify a target URL for
the Entry Types _Link_ or _Menu Item_. This field is ignored by other
Entry Types.
** For Entry Type _Link_, external URLs must include the full path
** For Entry Type _Menu Item_, use relative URLs. Typically these will
start with /eg/staff or /eg2/staff. Make sure to omit any localization
indicators in the path (such as en-US) if you use more than one
interface language in the staff client.
* _Entry Text_ - this is a free text field used by the Entry Type _Text
and/or HTML_. This field is ignored by other Entry Types.
** Basic HTML is acceptable in this field
** Unsafe HTML such as script tags will be automatically stripped when the
portal page is rendered, as will the style attribute.
** Tags and HTML attributes that can be used include:
*** strong, em, i, b
*** a, including the href and target attributes
*** class (and some of the Bootstrap text color classes like text-primary,
text-secondary, text-success, text-danger, text-warning, and text-info
can be useful here)
*** span, div
* _Entry Image URL_ - this is a text field to specify an image URL to use
for the icon that displays next to each portal page entry.
** It is recommended that images be approximately 48 x 48 pixels.
** External image links must use an https URL.
** Stock images on the Evergreen server can use a relative link, i.e.,
/images/portal/retreivepatron.png
** Stock images available in /images/portal/ include (image names are case sensitive):

*** back.png
*** batchimport.png

* _Page Column_ (required) - This accepts an integer value of 1, 2, 3,
etc. and indicates column position from left to right horizontally. More
than three columns will start to wrap around to a new line.
* _Column Position_ (required) - This accepts an integer value of 0, 1, 2,
etc. and indicates the “row” position from top to bottom vertically.
* _Owner_ (required) - This defaults to the workstation organizational
unit when adding a new Portal Page entry.
