= Permission Tree Display Entries =
:toc:

The *Permission Tree Display Entries* interface controls how permission groups display in the profile group dropdowns in the patron search, or in a user’s account. If you have added or deleted a permission group that you will be assigning users to, you will want to make sure the corresponding updates are made in the permission tree display.

To edit the permission group display entries, go to *Administration* > *Local Administration* > *Permission Tree Display Entries*. To view all current display entries, choose the consortium level organizational unit under *Permission Group Entries in Library* to view the current display entries. If the location selector is not set to the consortium level, no entries will display.

== Adding a Display Entry ==

To add a permission group to the tree display:

. In the permission tree, select the parent group for where you would like to add the group. For example, if you are adding a new Staff subgroup, click Staff.
. Click *Add*.

. In the popup window, choose the permission group you would like to add from the *Available Entries* dropdown. Note that only permission groups not currently in the display tree will appear as options.

. The *Add as root entry?* checkbox should be selected if the group you are adding should be a main category, for example, Patron. This setting only works if you click on the main Display Entries group. Otherwise, it will add a subentry.
. Click *Submit*. A “Display Entry successfully added” toast will appear at the bottom right of the screen.

. Use the *Move Up* and *Move Down* buttons at the top of the screen to change the order of the list if necessary.

. Click *Save*.

Now the permission group should show in the _Profile Group_ dropdown in the patron search and in the _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ dropdown in a user’s account edit tab.

NOTE: You do not need to click _Save_ after adding or removing groups; the entries will refresh automatically. You only need to click _Save_ when you use the _Move Up_ and _Move Down_ functions.

== Permissions ==

* MANAGE_CUSTOM_PERM_GRP_TREE

NOTE: The permission must be assigned at the consortium (0) depth to work properly.
