[NOTE]

Negative balances can appear when bills are voided.  One common example is a patron who needs to be refunded for paid lost items so that bill becomes voided within their account.

You can also choose _Prohibit negative balance on bills for lost materials_ or _Prohibit negative balance on bills for overdue materials_ library settings if you want to apply a specific condition.
