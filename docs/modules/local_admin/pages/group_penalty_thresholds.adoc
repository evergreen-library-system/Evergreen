:toc:

Group Penalty Thresholds block circulation transactions for users who exceed maximum check out limits, 
number of overdue items, or fines. Settings for your library are visible under 
*Administration -> Local Administration-> Group Penalty Thresholds*. There are four penalties in use now.


* PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES:	Blocks new circulations and renewals if patron exceeds X in fines
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_OVERDUE_COUNT:	Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X overdue items
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_CHECKOUT_COUNT: Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X items out
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_LOST_COUNT: Blocks new circulations and placing holds if patron exceeds X lost items


Accounts that meet or exceed penalty thresholds display an alert message when opened and require staff 
overrides for blocked transactions.

Group Penalty Thresholds may be set up on different levels in terms of patron profiles and libraries. 
Penalties on more specific levels of profile and/or library take precedence. This allows you to 
set up penalties on a higher level of profile and/or library system instead of branch, for most 
profiles and/or branches to share. If there are rules applied to lower level profiles or a branch, 
you just need to set them up for these specific profile/branch.
