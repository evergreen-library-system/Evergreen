== Searching the catalog ==

When the course materials module is active,
the public ctalog's Advanced Search screen has a
checkbox to limit your search only to results that
are associated with a course.

For more advanced searching, you can manually type
in the _on_reserve_ filter, which takes takes org
unit IDs.  For example, if you want to find biology
materials which are associated with libraries 5 and
6, you could search for:

    biology on_reserve(5, 6)

The filter can also be negated. To search for records
that are not attached to a course at library 5:

    biology -on_reserve(5)

Or records that are not attached to any courses
anywhere in your consortium:

    biology -on_reserve(all)
