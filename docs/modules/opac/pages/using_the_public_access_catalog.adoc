:toc:

== Basic Search ==

indexterm:[OPAC]

From the public catalog (OPAC), you can conduct a basic search of all materials owned by all
libraries in your Evergreen system.

This search can be as simple as typing keywords into the search box and clicking
the _Search_ button. Or you can make your search more precise by limiting your 
search by fields to search, material type or library location.

indexterm:[search box]

The _Homepage_ contains a single search box for you to enter search terms. You 
can get to the _Homepage_ at any time by clicking the _Basic Search_ link from
the leftmost link on the bar above your search results in the catalog, or you 
can enter a search anywhere you see a search box. From any page in the OPAC, you can also toggle the _Basic Search_ form visibility on and off by clicking the _Basic Search_ heading at the top of the page.

You can select to search by:

indexterm:[search, keyword]
indexterm:[search, title]
indexterm:[search, journal title]
indexterm:[search, author]
indexterm:[search, subject]
indexterm:[search, series]
indexterm:[search, bib call number]

* *Keyword*: finds the terms you enter anywhere in the entire record for an 
item, including title, author, subject, and other information.

* *Title*: finds the terms you enter in the title of an item.

* *Journal Title*: finds the terms you enter in the title of a serial bib 
record.

* *Author*: finds the terms you enter in the author of an item.

* *Subject*: finds the terms you enter in the subject of an item. Subjects are 
categories assigned to items according to a system such as the Library of 
Congress Subject Headings.

* *Series*: finds the terms you enter in the title of a multi-part series.

[TIP]
=============
To search an item call number, use <<numeric_search, _Advanced Search: 
Numeric_>> 
=============

=== Formats ===

You can limit your search by formats based on MARC fixed field type:

indexterm:[formats, books]
indexterm:[formats, audiobooks]
indexterm:[formats, video]
indexterm:[formats, music]


* *All Books*
* *All Music*
* *Audiocassette music recording*
* *Blu-ray* 
* *Braille*
* *Cassette audiobook*
* *CD Audiobook*
* *CD Music recording*
* *DVD* 
* *E-audio* 
* *E-book*
* *E-video* 
* *Equipment, games, toys*
* *Kit*
* *Large Print Book*
* *Map*
* *Microform*
* *Music Score*
* *Phonograph music recording*
* *Phonograph spoken recording*
* *Picture*
* *Serials and magazines*
* *Software and video games*
* *VHS*


==== Libraries ====

If you are using a catalog in a library or accessing a library’s online 
catalog from its homepage, the search will return items for your local 
library. If your library has multiple branches, the result will display items 
available at your branch and all branches of your library system separately.


== Advanced Search ==

Advanced searches allow users to perform more complex searches by providing more
options. Many kinds of searches can be performed from the _Advanced Search_ 
screen. You can access by clicking _Advanced Search_ on the catalog _Homepage_
or search results screen.

The available search options are the same as on the basic search. But you may 
use one or many of them simultaneously. If you want to combine more than three 
search options, use _Add Search Row_ button to add more search input rows. 
Clicking the _X_ button will close the search input row.


=== Sort Results ===

indexterm:[advanced search, sort results]

By default, the search results are in order of greatest to least relevance, see
 <<order_of_results, Order of Results>>. In the sort results menu you may select
 to order the search results by relevance, title, author, or publication date.


=== Search Library ===

indexterm:[advanced search, search library]

The current search library is displayed under _Search Library_ drop down menu. 
By default it is your library. The search returns results for your local library
only. If your library system has multiple branches, use the _Search Library_ box
to select different branches or the whole library system.


=== Limit to Available ===

indexterm:[advanced search, limit to available]


This checkbox is at the bottom line of _Search Library_. Select _Limit to 
Available_ to limit results to those titles that have items with a circulation 
status of "available" (by default, either _Available_ or _Reshelving_).

=== Exclude Electronic Resources ===

indexterm:[advanced search, exclude electronic resources]

This checkbox is below _Limit to Available_.  Select _Exclude Electronic 
Resources_ to limit results to those bibliographic records that do not have an 
"o" or "s" in the _Item Form_ fixed field (electronic forms) and overrides other
form limiters. 

This feature is optional and will not appear for patrons or staff until enabled.

[TIP]
===============
To display the *Exclude Electronic Resources* checkbox in the advance search 
page and search results, set
the 'ctx.exclude_electronic_checkbox' setting in config.tt2 to 1.
===============


=== Search Filter ===

indexterm:[advanced search, search filters]

You can filter your search by _Item Type_, _Item Form_, _Language_, _Audience_, 
_Video Format_, _Bib Level_, _Literary Form_, _Search Library_, and _Publication
Year_. Publication year is inclusive. For example, if you set _Publication Year_
Between 2005 and 2007, your results can include items published in 2005, 2006 
and 2007.

For each filter type, you may select multiple criteria by holding down the
 _CTRL_ key as you click on the options. If nothing is selected for a filter, 
the search will return results as though all options are selected.

==== Search Filter Enhancements ====

Enhancements to the Search Filters now makes it easier to view, remove, and modify search filters while viewing search results in the Evergreen OPAC.  Filters that are selected while conducting an advanced search in the Evergreen OPAC now appear below the search box in the search results interface.

For example, the screenshot below shows a Keyword search for "violin concerto" while filtering on Item Type: Musical sound recording.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/advanced_search_ex.jpg[search using search filters]

In the search results, the Item Type, Item Form, Language, Audience, Video Format, Bib Level, Literary Form, and Shelving Location filters appear directly below the search box.  Click on these to expand and see facets.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/advanced_search_filters.jpg[search results with search filter enhancements]

Each filter can be removed by clicking the X next to the filter name to modify the search within the search results screen.  Below the search box on the search results screen, there is also a link to _Refine My Original Search_, which will bring the user back to the advanced search screen where the original search parameters selected can be viewed and modified.


[#numeric_search]
indexterm:[advanced search, numeric search]

=== Numeric Search ===

If you have details on the exact item you wish to search for, use the _Numeric 
Search_ tab on the advanced search page. Use the drop-down menu to select your 
search by _ISBN_, _ISSN_, _Bib Call Number_, _Call Number (Shelf Browse)_, 
_LCCN_, _TCN_, or _Item Barcode_. Enter the information and then click the 
_Search_ button.

=== Expert Search ===

indexterm:[advanced search, expert search]

If you are familiar with MARC cataloging, you may search by MARC tag in the 
_Expert Search_ option on the left of the screen. Enter the three-digit tag 
number, the subfield if relevant, and the value or text that corresponds to the 
tag. For example, to search by publisher name, enter `260 b Random House`. To 
search several tags simultaneously, use the _Add Row_ option. Click _Submit_ to 
run the search. 

[TIP]
=============
Use the MARC Expert Search only as a last resort, as it can take much longer to 
retrieve results than by using indexed fields. For example, rather than running 
an expert search for "245 a Gone with the wind", simply do a regular title 
search for "Gone with the wind".
=============

== Boolean operators ==

indexterm:[search, AND operator]
indexterm:[search, OR operator]
indexterm:[search, NOT operator]
indexterm:[search, boolean]

Classic search interfaces (that is, those used primarily by librarians) forced 
users to learn the art of crafting search phrases with Boolean operators. To a 
large extent this was due to the inability of those systems to provide relevancy
ranking beyond a "last in, first out" approach. Thankfully, Evergreen, like most
modern search systems, supports a rather sophisticated relevancy ranking system 
that removes the need for Boolean operators in most cases.

By default, all terms that have been entered in a search query are joined with 
an implicit `AND` operator. Those terms are required to appear in the designated
 fields to produce a matching record: a search for _golden compass_ will search 
for entries that contain both _golden_ *and* _compass_. 

Words that are often considered Boolean operators, such as _AND_, _OR_, and 
_NOT_, are not special in Evergreen: they are treated as just another search 
term. For example, a title search for `golden and compass` will not return the 
title _Golden Compass_. 

However, Evergreen does support Boolean searching for those rare cases where you
might require it, using symbolic operators as follows:

.Boolean symbolic operators
[width="50%",options="header"]
|=================================
| Operator | Symbol    | Example
| AND      | `&&`      | `a && b`
| OR       | `\|\|`      | `a \|\| b`
| NOT      | `-`_term_ | `a -b`
|=================================

[[library_groups]]
== Library Groups in the OPAC ==

indexterm:[Library Groups]

To configure Library Groups, please see the xref:admin:library_groups_admin.adoc[Library Groups Administration] documentation.

Screenshots for the below are taken from the Bootstrap OPAC (BOOPAC) but
Library Groups are also available in the Template Toolkit OPAC (TPAC).

The *Library* dropdown includes Library Groups as well as the Depth
Selector.

Library Groups location on the Basic Search page:

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/library_group_location_bs.png[Library Groups in Basic Search]

On the Advanced Search page, Library Groups as well as Shelving Location
Groups and the Depth Selector are gathered into a dropdown labelled
*Where*, and this can be seen below the Search Library dropdown:

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/library_group_location_as.png[Library Groups in Advanced Search]

The motivation for collecting these elements into a new dropdown is that
they are secondary or subordinate to the search location -- the
organizational unit tells us what location groups, library groups, and
depths are relevant or make sense -- and are mutually exclusive among
each other.

If a library is using the locg parameter (or equivalent), and there is
no other search context, the Where dropdown will rely on locg (or
equivalent) to populate and does not dynamically update in Advanced
Search.

== Search Tips ==

indexterm:[search, stop words]
indexterm:[search, truncation]

Evergreen tries to approach search from the perspective of a major search 
engine: the user should simply be able to enter the terms they are looking for 
as a general keyword search, and Evergreen should return results that are most 
relevant given those terms. For example, you do not need to enter author's last 
name first, nor do you need to enter an exact title or subject heading. 
Evergreen is also forgiving about plurals and alternate verb endings, so if you 
enter _dogs_, Evergreen will also find items with _dog_. 

The search engine has no _stop words_ (terms are ignored by the search engine): 
a title search for `to be or not to be` (in any order) yields a list of titles 
with those words. 

* Don’t worry about white space, exact punctuation, or capitalization. 

. White spaces before or after a word are ignored. So, a search for `[ golden 
compass ]` gives the same results as a search for `[golden compass]`.

. A double dash or a colon between words is reduced to a blank space. So, a 
title search for _golden:compass_ or _golden -- compass_ is equivalent to 
_golden compass_. 

. Punctuation marks occurring within a word are removed; the exception is \_. 
So, a title search for _gol_den com_pass_ gives no result. 

. Diacritical marks and solitary `&` or `|` characters located anywhere in the 
search term are removed. Words or letters linked together by `.` (dot) are 
joined together without the dot. So, a search for _go|l|den & comp.ass_ is 
equivalent to _golden compass_. 

. Upper and lower case letters are equivalent. So, _Golden Compass_ is the same 
as _golden compass_. 

* Enter your search words in any order. So, a search for _compass golden_ gives 
the same results as a search for _golden compass_. Adding more search words 
gives fewer but more specific results. 

** This is also true for author searches. Both _David Suzuki_ and _Suzuki, 
David_ will return results for the same author. 

* Use specific search terms. Evergreen will search for the words you specify, 
not the meanings, so choose search terms that are likely to appear in an item 
description. For example, the search _luxury hotels_ will produce more 
relevant results than _nice places to stay_.

* Search for an exact phrase using double-quotes. For example ``golden compass''. 

** The order of words is important for an exact phrase search. _golden compass_ 
is different than _compass golden_. 

** White space, punctuation and capitalization are removed from exact phrases as
 described above. So a phrase retains its search terms and its relative order, 
but not special characters and not case. 

** Two phrases are joined by and, so a search for _"golden compass"_ _"dark 
materials"_ is equivalent to _golden compass_ *and* _dark materials_. 


* **Truncation**
Words may be right-hand truncated using an asterisk. Use a single asterisk * to 
truncate any number of characters.
(example: _environment* agency_)


== Search Methodology ==

[#stemming]

=== Stemming ===

indexterm:[search, stemming]

A search for _dogs_ will also return hits with the word dog and a search for 
parenting will return results with the words parent and parental. This is 
because the search uses stemming to help return the most relevant results. That 
is, words are reduced to their stem (or root word) before the search is 
performed. 

The stemming algorithm relies on common English language patterns - like verbs 
ending in _ing_ - to find the stems. This is more efficient than looking up each
search term in a dictionary and usually produces desirable results. However, it 
also means the search will sometimes reduce a word to an incorrect stem and 
cause unexpected results. To prevent a word or phrase from stemming, put it in 
double-quotes to force an exact search. For example, a search for `parenting` 
will also return results for `parental`, but a search for `"parenting"` will 
not.

Understanding how stemming works can help you to create more relevant searches, 
but it is usually best not to anticipate how a search term will be stemmed. For 
example, searching for `gold compass` does not return the same results as 
`golden compass`, because `-en` is not a regular suffix in English, and 
therefore the stemming algorithm does not recognize _gold_ as a stem of 
_golden_. 


[#order_of_results]

=== Order of Results ===

indexterm:[search, order of results]

By default, the results are listed in order of relevance, similar to a search 
engine like Google. The relevance is determined using a number of factors, 
including how often and where the search terms appear in the item description, 
and whether the search terms are part of the title, subject, author, or series. 
The results which best match your search are returned first rather than results 
appearing in alphabetical or chronological order. 

In the _Advanced Search_ screen, you may select to order the search results by 
relevance, title, author, or publication date before you start the search. You 
can also re-order your search results using the _Sort Results_ dropdown list on 
the search result screen.


== Search Results ==

indexterm:[search results]

The search results are a list of relevant works from the catalog. If there are
many results, they are divided into several pages. At the top of the list, you 
can see the total number of results and go back and forth between the pages 
by clicking the links that say _Previous_ or _Next_ on top or bottom of the 
list. You can also click on the adjacent results page number listed. These page 
number links allow you to skip to that results page, if your search results 
needed multiple pages to display. Here is an example: 


image::using_the_public_access_catalog/search_results.jpg[Search results]

Brief information about the title, such as author, edition, publication date, 
etc. is displayed under each title. The icons beside the brief information 
indicate formats such as books, audio books, video recordings, and other 
formats. If you hover your mouse over the icon, a text explanation will show up 
in a small pop-up box. 

Clicking the title or the title image goes to the title details. Clicking an author searches all 
works by the author. If you want to place a hold on the title, click _Place 
Hold_ beside the format icons.

On the top right, there is a _Limit to Available_ checkbox. Checking this box 
will filter out those titles with no available items in the library or 
libraries at the moment. Usually you will see your search results are 
re-displayed with fewer titles. 

When enabled, under the _Limit to Available_ checkbox, there is an _Exclude 
Electronic Resources_ checkbox.  Checking this box will filter out materials 
that are cataloged as electronic in form.

The _Sort by_ dropdown list is found at the top of the search results. To re-sort the search results, select an option from the dropdown and click _Upgrade Search Results_.

=== Facets: Authors, Subjects, and Series ===

indexterm:[search results, facets: authors, subjects, and series]

At the left, you may see a list of _Personal Author_, _Topic Subject_, 
_Series Title_, and _Name Subject_. Selecting any one of these links filters your current search results 
using that subject, author, or series to narrow down your current results. The 
facet filters can be undone by clicking the link a second time, thus returning 
your original results before the facet was activated. 

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/search_facets.png[search facets]


=== Availability ===

indexterm:[search results, availability]

The number of available items and total items are displayed under each search 
result's call number. If you are using a catalog inside a library or accessing
a library's online catalog from its homepage, you will see how many items are
available in the library under each title, too. If the library belongs to a 
multi-branch library system you will see an extra row under each title showing 
how many items are available in all branches.


image::using_the_public_access_catalog/branch_search.jpg[branch search]

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/search_results_quantity.png[search results quantity]

You may also click the _Show More Details_ link at the top of the results page, 
next to the _Limit to available items_ check box, to view each search result's 
items' individual call number, status, and shelving location. 

[[did_you_mean]]
=== Did You Mean? Search Suggestions

indexterm:[Searching,Search Suggestions] 

As of 3.7, the work for Did You Mean enables search suggestions for a search comprising a single word within a single search class. For the purposes of suggestions, a search class in Evergreen is a keyword, title, author, series, or subject. 

As of 3.11, search suggestions are offered for phrases and multi-word search within a single search class. Search suggestions can also leverage variant headings (4xx fields) in Authority records in this latest version, as long as search terms in these fields are in the symspell dictionary for the specified search class. Quoted phrases in search inputs require strict term order and adjacency for the phrase portion of the suggestion generated for the phrase(s), while unquoted search inputs do not require strict order and adjacency. 

Search suggestions are available in the public catalog (both TPAC and Bootstrap versions), the Children's OPAC (KPAC), and the Angular Staff Catalog.

Future iterations of this project are planning to add cross class and other search suggestion mechanisms.

Search suggestions are based on existing bibliographic data, and are
offered for potentially correctable spelling mistakes. A new set of
tables have been added to collect bibliographic data and build an
internal dictionary of potential search suggestions. When a catalog
search meets criteria for offering suggestions, this dictionary is used
to generate the suggestions.

The end user will be shown a configurable number of suggestions,
hyperlinked to execute a new search based on that suggestion. Any search
options such as Format that were initially set will be carried over to
the new search.

Evergreen’s existing use of search term stemming has not been altered as
a consequence of this work.

For information on how to configure Did You Mean, please see the xref:admin_initial_setup:dym_admin.adoc[Administrator documentation].

=== Search Results Display

In all cases, search suggestions will be offered for potentially
correctable spelling mistakes if a search retrieves fewer than the configured number of results; and potential suggested terms appear at
least the configured number of times within the bibliographic data. Clicking a
suggestion will execute a new search.

==== Public Catalog (TPAC)

Search suggestions are offered under the search bar. Clicking a
suggestion will execute a new search. In both examples below, the test
system was configured to offer 3 suggestions.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/dym_tpac.png[TPAC Search Suggestions]

In the case of zero hits, suggestions are given both under the search
bar as well as in the search results area.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/dym_tpac_nohits.png[TPAC Search Suggestions when there are no hits]

==== Public Catalog (Bootstrap)

Search suggestions display in the same locations in the new Bootstrap
public catalog as they do in the TPAC.

An example of a single word single class suggestion is below:

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/did_you_mean_no_results.jpg[Suggestions for Bootstrap]

Examples of multi word single class suggestions are below:

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/dym_opac_multiword.png[OPAC Multi word suggestion example 1]

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/dym_opac_multiword_2.png[OPAC Multi word suggestion example 2]

==== Public Catalog (KPAC)

Search suggestions display in the right-hand sidebar next to Search
Results.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/dym_kpac.png[KPAC Search Suggestions]

==== Staff Catalog

Search suggestions in the Staff Catalog appear at the bottom of the
search area. Images showing this location can be seen in the xref:admin_initial_setup:dym_admin.adoc[Administrator documentation].

=== Viewing a record ===

indexterm:[search results, viewing a record]

Click on a search result's title to view a detailed record of the title, 
including descriptive information, location and availability, current holds, and
options for placing holds, add to my list, and print/email. Click on _More Details_ for more information and record details.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/viewing_record.jpg[Viewing Record]
image::using_the_public_access_catalog/more_details_record.jpg[More Details Button in Record]

[[geosort]]
==== Sort by Geographic Proximity

indexterm:[Geographic Sort,Search Results,Searching]

The sort by geographic proximity feature allows library patrons to sort
holdings within a bibliographic record by geographic distance. This
feature requires a 3rd party geographic location service in order to
function. Each Evergreen instance will need to secure its own geographic
location service. For more information on setting up this feature, please see the xref:admin_initial_setup:geosort_admin.adoc[Administrator Documentation].

This feature is available in both the Bootstrap and TPAC versions of the
public catalog. The screenshots are from the Bootstrap catalog.

When a patron selects a bibliographic record, they are taken to the
record details interface. At the top of the holdings grid is a box to
enter an address or postal code.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/geosort_entry_box.png[OPAC Entry Box for Geographic Sort]

The input box will accept several variants on a full address, but in
order to return a correct calculation there must be at least a
city/state or zipcode entry. Address entries make use of a 3rd party API
to calculate distance from the library branches and specifics about what
values are accepted will depend on your Geographic Location Services
provider.

Enter an address or postal code in the box and click *Go*. The holdings
grid will resort to display the items owned by the closest library at
the top of the grid, with remaining libraries sorted by increasing
distance from the address entry. The distance display defaults to
kilometers but can be changed to show miles via a Library Setting.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/geosort_results_km.png[Geographic Sort Results]

To return to the default item sort, click the *Use default item sort*
button.

If the configured Geographic Location API is not able to resolve an
address entry, an error message will appear:

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/geosort_retrieval_error.png[Geographic Sort Error]

== Details ==

indexterm:[search results, details]

The record shows details such as the cover image, title, author, publication
information, and an abstract or summary, if available.

Near the top of the record, users can easily see the number of items that
are currently available in the system and how many current holds are on the
title. 

If there are other formats and editions of the same work in the 
database, links to those alternate formats will display. The formats used
in this section are based on the configurable catalog icon formats.


image::using_the_public_access_catalog/record_details.jpg[Record Details]

The Record Details view shows how many items are at the library or libraries
you have selected, and whether they are available or checked out. It also
displays the Call Number and Shelving Location for locating the item on the shelves.
Clicking on Text beside the call number will allow you to send the item's call
number by text message, if desired. Clicking the location library link will
reveal information about owning library, such as address and open hours.

Below the local details you can open up various tabs to display more
information. You can select Reviews and More to see the book’s summaries and
reviews, if available. You can select Shelf Browser to view items appearing near
the current item on the library shelves. Often this is a good way to browse for
similar items. You can select MARC Record to display the record in MARC format. 
If your library offers the service, clicking on Awards, Reviews, and Suggested
Reads will reveal that additional information.

[NOTE]
==========
Items are sorted by (in order): library, call number/item notes, barcode, shelving location, circulation modifier, status, and due date.
==========



=== Placing Holds ===

indexterm:[search results, placing holds]

Holds can be placed on either title results or search results page. If the item 
is available, it will be pulled from the shelf and held for you. If all items 
at your local library are checked out, you will be placed on a waiting list and 
you will be notified when items become available. 

On title details page, you can select the _Place Hold_ link in the upper right 
corner of the record to reserve the item. You will need your library account 
user name and password. You may choose to be notified by phone or email.

If you have a phone number and/or email set up for your notifications, they will show up in
the checkboxes.  Make sure the checked boxes corespond to the notification method you want.  Boxes
will be grayed out if you don't have anything for the field.  In this example, _Email_ is grayed
out because the account doesn't have an email.  You can always edit the phone number for notification.  
To adjust your notification settings, go to your account in the OPAC and _Preferences_ and _Notifications_.

You can view and cancel a hold at anytime. Before your hold is captured, which 
means an item has been held waiting for you to pick up, you can edit, suspend or activate it.

If you want to suspend the hold to be filled at a specific date, check off _Suspend this Hold?_ and _Set activiation date_
to bring up the calendar tool.  From your account you can also suspend and activate holds that are already placed.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/placing_holds.jpg[Placing Holds]

== Advanced Hold Options ==

Clicking the *Advanced Hold Options* link will take you into the
metarecord level hold feature, where you can select multiple formats
and/or languages, if available.

Selecting multiple formats will not place all of these formats on hold.
For example, selecting CD Audiobook and Book implies that either the CD
format or the book format is the acceptable format to fill the hold. If
no format is selected, then any of the available formats may be used to
fill the hold. The same applies to selecting multiple languages.

image::hold_management/advanced_hold.jpg[Place Hold screen with Advanced Options]


=== Printing and Emailing Records ===

indexterm:[opac printing, opac emailing]

Evergreen now provides additional functionality for printing and emailing bibliographic record and holdings information from the catalog. Users can print or email bibliographic information from an individual bibliographic record or from a basket.
  
image::using_the_public_access_catalog/print_email_records.jpg[Location of Print and Email function]

After selecting Print or Email, the user will be presented with a preview of the printout or email, respectively. From the preview users can choose to view Brief or Full record information (Full includes holdings information) and how records should be sorted (Author, Title, Publication Date). Holdings information can also be limited to a certain library. Users can be required to log in to their OPAC account to send an email or this feature can be configured to allow sending an email without signing in to the OPAC.

*Print Preview*

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/print_records_screen.jpg[Record Print Preview]

*Email Preview*

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/email_records_screen.jpg[Email Preview, not logged in to OPAC]

If you're logged into the OPAC, your email saved in your account settings will appear.  If you're not logged in, fill out the email field.

There are two views for the record: Brief and Full.

Printing from the OPAC while not logged in is controlled by a Library Setting called “Allow record emailing without login”. If set to True, users are not required to log in to an OPAC account  to use this feature. Instead they can provide their email address and answer a CAPTCHA test.  If set to False, users will be required to log in to their OPAC account and Evergreen will email the records to the address set in their account or they may provide a different email address.  

=== Disabling/Enabling Highlighting ===

Search results default to highlighting keywords found.  In this example, "concerto" was searched 
and the title in the search results matched.  You can _Disable Highlighting_ if you dislike the feature 
and _Enable Highlighting_ whenever you wish.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/highlighting.jpg[Highlighting toggle]

=== Permalink ===

The record summary page offers a link to a shorter permalink that
 can be used for sharing the record with others. All URL parameters are stripped
 from the link with the exception of the locg and copy_depth parameters. Those
 parameters are maintained so that people can share a link that displays just
 the holdings from one library/system or displays holdings from all libraries
 with a specific library's holdings floating to the top.

image::using_the_public_access_catalog/permalink.jpg[Permalink]

=== Going back ===

indexterm:[search results, going back]
