In the *My Account* -> *Account Summary* page, you can see when your account
expires and your total number of items checked out, items on hold, and items
ready for pickup. In addition, the Account Summary page lists your current fines
and payment history.


== Items Checked Out ==

indexterm:[my account, items checked out]

Users can manage items currently checked out, like renew specific items. Users
can also view overdue items and see how many renewals they have remaining for
specific item.

As of Evergreen version 2.9, sorting of selected columns is available in the
 _Items Checked Out_ and _Check Out History_ pages. Clicking on the appropriate
 column heads sorts the contents from "ascending" to "descending" to "no sort".
(The "no sort" restores the original list as presented in the screen.) The sort 
indicator (an up or down arrow) is placed to the right of the column head, as 
appropriate.

Within *Items Checked Out* -> *Current Items Checked Out*, the following column
 headers can be sorted: _Title_, _Author_, _Renewals Left_, _Due Date_,
_Barcode_, and _Call Number_.

Within *Items Checked Out* -> *Check Out History*, the following column headers 
can be sorted: _Title_, _Author_, _Checkout Date_, _Due Date_, _Date Returned_, 
_Barcode_, and _Call Number_

area.

manage items currently being requested. In *Holds* -> *Items on Hold*, the 
content shown can be sorted by clicking on the following column headers:
_Title_, _Author_, and _Format_ (based on format name represented by the icon).

Actions include:

* Cancel - remove the hold request 

Edit options include: 

* Change pick up library 
* Change the _Cancel unless filled by_ date, also known as the hold expiration

area.

[[hold_groups_opac]]
=== Hold Groups

indexterm:[Hold Groups]

Screenshots in this section are taken from the Bootstrap OPAC (BOOPAC),
but similar functionality is available in the Template Toolkit OPAC
(TPAC).

A patron who is a member of a publicly visible xref:circulation:basic_holds.adoc#hold_groups[Hold Group] will see
a new option on the Holds menu of My Account labelled *Hold Groups*.

image::my_account/opac_hold_groups.png[My Account Hold Groups]

If the *Hold Groups* menu item is selected, the patron will see a list
of Hold Groups of which they are a member, as well as a link for
removing themselves from the Hold Group.

image::my_account/opac_remove_hg.png[Remove Me From Hold Group]

Only those Hold Groups that were marked by staff as “publicly visible”
are displayed. If the patron does not belong to any publicly visible
Hold Groups, the Hold Group menu item is not displayed at all.

Holds placed through a Hold Group can be modified by patrons in the same
way as other holds (e.g., suspended, cancelled, etc.).

== Preferences ==

indexterm:[my account, account preferences]

From here you can manage display preferences including your *Personal Information*, 
*Notification*, *Search and History*, and *Lists*. 
Additional static information, such as your _Account Expiration Date_, can be 
found under *Personal Information*.

For example: 

* Personal Information

** _Change password_ - allows patrons to change their password.

** _Change email address_	- allows patrons to change their email address.

** _Change username_ - allows patrons to change their username.

** _Preferred Language field_ - As of 3.9 this field contains a dropdown listing available locales for your Evergreen instance. Locales are configured in the `config.i18n_locales` table and you can use this feature to send action trigger messages in different languages. For more information please see xref:admin:actiontriggers.adoc#creating_alternate_message_templates[Creating Alternate Message Templates].

** Contains other information such as home library, address, phone, etc.



*  Notification Preferences

[WARNING]
========
Turning off the _Keep history of checked out items?_ or _Keep history of holds?_ features will permanently delete all entries in the relevant patron screens.  After this is unchecked,
there is no way for a patron to recover those data.
========


After changing any of these settings, you must click _Save_ to store your 
preferences.

=== Authorize other people to use your account ===

indexterm:[Allow others to use my account]
indexterm:[checking out,materials on another patron's account]
indexterm:[holds,picking up another patron's]
indexterm:[privacy waiver]


If your library has enabled it, you can authorize other people to use
your account. In the _Search and History_ tab
under _Preferences_, find the section labeled _"Allow others to use
my account"_. Enter the name and indicate that the
specified person is allowed to place holds, pickup holds, view
borrowing history, and check out items on their account.  This
information will also be visible to circulation staff at your library.

== Patron Messages ==

The Patron Message Center provides a way for libraries to communicate with 
patrons through messages that can be accessed through the patron's OPAC account.
 Library staff can create messages manually by adding an OPAC visible Patron 
Note to an account.  Messages can also be automatically generated through an 
Action Trigger event.  Patrons can access and manage messages within their OPAC 
account.  See Circulation - Patron Record - Patron Message Center for more 
information on adding messages to patron accounts.

*Viewing Patron Messages in the OPAC*

Patrons will see an option for *Messages* in their OPAC *Account Summary* page, as well as a 
notification of *Unread Messages* in the banner towards the top right.

image::my_account/messages_buttons.jpg[How to Get to Messages]

Patrons will see a list of the messages from the library by clicking on the 
*Messages* tab.

image::my_account/messages_inbox.jpg[Messages Inbox]

Patrons can click on the *Read* button to see the message.  After viewing the
message, it will automatically be marked as read.  Patrons have the options to 
mark the message as unread and to delete the message.

image::my_account/message_read.jpg[Message Contents]

NOTE: Patron deleted messages will still appear in the patron's account in the 
staff client under Other -> Message Center.

== Reservations ==

When patrons place a reservation for a particular item at a particular time,
they can check on its status using the *Reservations* tab.

After they initially place a reservation, its status will display as _Reserved_.
After staff capture the reservation, the status will change to _Ready for Pickup_.
After the patron picks up the reservation, the status will change to _Checked Out_.
Finally, after the patron returns the item, the reservation will be removed from
the list.

[NOTE]
====================
This interface pulls its timezone from the Library
Settings Editor.  Make sure that you have a timezone
listed for your library in the Library Settings Editor
before using this feature.
====================

[[myaccount_payments]]
== Making Payments in MyAccount ==

[NOTE]
====================
The below instructions are specific to libraries using Stripe with Evergreen 3.8 or higher.
====================

If a patron has bills on their account and their library permits online payments, the patron will be given options to pay all or selected bills via MyAccount.

After logging in to MyAccount, the patron should select the **Charges** menu item, and then select **Current Charges**.

image::my_account/opac_current_charges.png[MyAccount Current Charges]

Next, they should (optionally) select the charges they wish to pay and then select either **Pay Selected Charges** or **Pay All Charges**.

image::my_account/opac_select_charges.png[Select Charges]

They will be prompted to enter their credit card information on the next screen. The patron should enter their credit card information and select **Submit Payment**. There is no confirmation step. Note that credit card information is not masked, so patrons should take care if they are in a public place. 

image::my_account/opac_cc_entry.png[Credit Card Entry]

There will be a processing message displayed while the payment is processed.

image::my_account/opac_cc_inprocess.png[Credit Card Processing]

Lastly, the patron will receive a confirmation and an option to print a receipt. 

image::my_account/opac_cc_receipt.png[Credit Card Receipt]

Receipts can also be printed or emailed by navigating to **Charges → Payment History** and selecting the relevant print or email option from the Payment History grid. Receipts can be configured in the xref:admin:actiontriggers.adoc[Notifications and Action Triggers] interface.

=== Error Messages === 

If a credit card is declined, the patron will be given a declined message when they attempt to submit payment information.

image::my_account/opac_cc_declined.png[Credit Card Declined]

Stripe supports sending various types of error messages, including messages for an expired card, invalid CVV code, incorrect zip code, and more.

If there is an error in Evergreen’s Stripe configuration, the patron will be presented with an error message when they attempt to initiate a payment. This will be displayed at the point when a patron selects either the **Pay Selected Charges** or **Pay All Charges** button, before the payment form is rendered.
