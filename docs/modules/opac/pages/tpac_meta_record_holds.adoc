= TPAC Metarecord Search and Metarecord Level Holds =
:toc:

Metarecords are compilations of individual bibliographic records that represent
the same work. This compilation allows for several records to be represented on
a single line on the TPAC search results page, which can help to reduce result
duplications.


*Advanced Search Page*

Selecting the *Group Formats and Editions* checkbox on the Advanced Search page
allows the user to perform a metarecord search.

[TIP]
Administrators can also configure the catalog to default to a *Group Formats and
Editions* search by enabling the relevant config.tt2 setting on
the server. Setting this option will pre-select the checkbox on the Advanced 
Search and Search Result Pages. Users can remove the checkmark, but new searches
will revert to the default search behavior.

*Search Results Page*

Within the Search Results page, users can also refine their searches and filter
on metarecord search results by selecting the *Group Formats and Editions*
checkbox.

The metarecord search results will display both the representative metarecord
bibliographic data and the combined metarecord holdings data (if the holdings
data is OPAC visible).

The number of records represented by the metarecord are displayed in parenthesis
next to the title.

The formats contained within the metarecord are displayed under the title.

For the metarecord search result, the *Place Hold* link defaults to a metarecord
level hold.

To place a metarecord level hold:

. Click the *Place Hold* link.
. Users who are not logged into their accounts will be directed to the *Log in
to Your Account* screen, where they will enter their username and password.
Users who are already logged into their accounts will be directed to the *Place
Hold* screen.
. Within the *Place Hold* screen, users can select the multiple formats and/or
languages that are available.
. Continue to enter any additional hold information (such as Pickup Location), if needed.
. Click *Submit*.

Selecting multiple formats will not place all of these formats on hold for the
user. For example, a user cannot select CD Audiobook and Book and expect to
place both the CD and book on hold at the same time. Instead, the user is
implying that either the CD format or the book format is the acceptable format
to fill the hold. If no format is selected, then any of the available formats
may be used to fill the hold. The same holds true for selecting multiple
languages.

*Advanced Hold Options*

When users place a hold on an individual bibliographic record they will see an
*Advanced Hold Options* link within the Place Hold screen. Clicking the
*Advanced Hold Options* link will take the users into the metarecord level hold
feature, enabling them to select multiple formats and/or languages.

*Metarecord Constituent Records Page*

The TPAC now includes a Metarecord Constituent Records page, which displays a
listing of the individual bibliographic records grouped within the metarecord.
Access the Metarecord Constituent Records page by clicking on the metarecord
title on the Search Results page.

This will allow the user to view the results for grouped records.

*Show Holds on Bib*

Within the staff client, *Show Holds on Bib* for a metarecord level hold will
take the staff member into the Metarecord Constituent Records page.

*Global Flag: OPAC Metarecord Hold Formats Attribute*

To utilize the metarecord level hold feature, the Global Flag: OPAC Metarecord
Hold Formats Attribute must be enabled and its value set at mr_hold_format,
which is the system's default configuration.
