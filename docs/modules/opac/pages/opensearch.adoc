== Adding OpenSearch to Firefox browser ==

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.
More information about OpenSearch can be found on their
http://www.opensearch.org[website].

The following example illustrates how to add an OpenSearch source to the list
of search sources in a Firefox browser:

. Navigate to any catalog page in your Firefox browser and click on the top
   right box's dropdown and select the option for *Add "Example Consortium OpenSearch"*.
   The label will match the current scope.

. At this point, it will add a new search option for the location the catalog
   is currently using. In this example, that is CONS (searching the whole
   consortium).

. Enter search terms to begin a keyword search using this source. The next
   image illustrates an example search for "mozart" using the sample bib
   record set.
