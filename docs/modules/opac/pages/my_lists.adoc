The *My Lists* feature replaces the bookbag feature that was available in versions prior to 2.2.  The *My Lists* feature is a part of the Template Toolkit OPAC that is available in version 2.2.  This feature enables you to create temporary and permanent lists; create and edit notes for items in lists; place holds on items in lists; and share lists via RSS feeds and CSV files.

There is now a direct link to *My Lists* from the *My Account* area in the top right part of the screen.  This gives users the ability to quickly access their lists while logged into the catalog.

As of version 3.2, xref:opac:batch_actions_from_search.adoc#batch_actions_from_search[Batch Actions from Search Results] has replaced the old Temporary Lists feature, as well as enabled multiple selections from a search results list.

== Local Call Number in My Lists ==

When a title is added to a list in the OPAC, a local call number will be displayed in the list to assist patrons in locating the physical item.  Evergreen will look at the following locations to identify the most relevant call number to display in the list:  

1)	Physical location - the physical library location where the search takes place

2)	Preferred library - the Preferred Search Location, which is set in patron OPAC account Search and History Preferences, or the patron's Home Library

3)	Search library - the search library or org unit that is selected in the OPAC search interface

The call number that is displayed will be the most relevant call number to the searcher.  If the patron is searching at the library, Evergreen will display a call number from that library location.  If the patron is not searching at a library, but is logged in to their OPAC account, Evergreen will display a call number from their Home Library or Preferred Search Location.  If the patron is not searching at the library and is not signed in to their OPAC account, then Evergreen will display a call number from the org unit, or library, that they choose to search in the OPAC search interface.

The local call number and associated library location will appear in the list:
