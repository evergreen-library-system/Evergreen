= Eresource link click tracking =
:toc:

Evergreen has a feature
to track user clicks on eresources in the public
catalog.

This feature provides usage data on eresources in
the catalog.  One potential use for this feature
is to provide the equivalent of circulation
statistics for online course materials.

Data can be accessed via the Evergreen reporter.

== Data collection ==

This feature does not collect any personally
identifiable data about the user who clicks
on the link.  The pieces of data that are
collected are:

* The URL clicked
* The time it was clicked
* The bibliographic record that contains the
URL.
* The ID, name, and number of any courses
that use the bibliographic record.

== Enabling the feature ==

The new tables can grow forever, so before
enabling this feature:

* Ensure that you are monitoring disk space on
the server(s) that house your postgres database.
* Decide on a retention period for click data,
and set up the provided
``delete_old_eresource_link_clicks``
script to delete old data regularly.

To enable this feature:

. Set the
``opac.eresources.link_click_tracking``
global flag to true.
. Restart memcached and apache HTTP server.


== Accuracy ==

Statistics from this feature are collected
on a best efforts basis, and have certain
limitations when it comes to accuracy:

* It does
not provide any guarantees against somebody
deliberately inflating the statistics of a
particular link, either through repeated network
calls or repeatedly clicking on a link they don't
actually intend to read.
* Clicks from certain very old, unsupported browsers
(notable Microsoft Internet Explorer) will
not be counted.
* Major bots are excluded, but uncommon bots and
bots that set a misleading User Agent header are
included unless they are blocked at the web server
or load balancer level.
