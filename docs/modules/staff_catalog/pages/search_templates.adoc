Search templates all you to save search options and inputs for future use.

You may create a search template using any xref:staff_catalog:searching_the_catalog.adoc#search_panes[search pane]. However, since the Keyword Search pane contains the most options, search templates are most useful on this pane. 

You can follow these same instructions to make templates for any search pane.

To access the Search Templates menu, select _Search Templates_ below the Library Selector in the top-right corner of the Staff Catalog page. A dropdown menu opens.

== Creating a Template ==

To create a search template, first make all desired selections. You may make selections in the following fields: Format, Catalog Field, Matching, Sort Results, and Publication Year. 

You may also add additional search rows. If you use multiple search rows, you may also make a selection in the Join With field.

IMPORTANT: Filters and checkbox selections _will not_ be saved in a search template.
