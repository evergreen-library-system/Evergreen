:toc:

The basket is used to temporarily collect bibliographic records. The basket can be used to place a hold on multiple records at once, print or email record details, add records to a record bucket, and export records. 

You only have one basket in Evergreen. If you need to save a basket for later, or create a new basket, you will need to add the basket to a bucket, then empty the basket.

The basket is temporary.

== Adding Records to the Basket ==

IMPORTANT: The basket will empty if you log out of Evergreen.

To add a record to the basket, first find the record by conducting a search in the _Staff Catalog_.

Then, check the checkbox that appears between the result number and the cover image of the desired result. The record is added to your basket, and the number next to the _Basket Actions_ button in the search form increases.

To add all records on the page, check the checkbox between the search form and the search results. All results on the page are selected.

To add records from additional pages, navigate to the desired page and check the same checkbox between the search form and the search results.

To add all search results, select _Basket Actions_ in the search form below the _Library Selector_. 

CAUTION: If your search returned many results, this action may take a long time.

Records appear in the basket exactly as they appear in the search results. However, _Facets_ are unavailable in the basket.

== Place Hold ==

To place a hold on every item in the basket, select _Basket Actions_ -> _Place Hold_. The _Place Hold_ form appears. Place the hold the same way you place a hold for a single item. 

This will be a title or part level hold. Make sure to select parts for each title as needed.

== Print Title Details ==

To print the details of each record in the basket, select _Basket Actions_ -> _Print Title Details_. A printer-friendly version of the basket will appear.

Records will appear in the same order they appear in the basket. They will be numbered.

Each entry on the list will contain the bibliographic ID number, ISBN, title, author, publisher, publication date, and item type.

== Email Title Details == 

To email a summary of the basket contents, select _Basket Actions_ -> Email Title Details. A plaintext summary of the basket will be emailed to the address associated with your Evergreen account.

The email will contain title, author, publisher, publication date, item type, bibliographic ID number, and ISBN.

== Add Basket to Bucket ==
