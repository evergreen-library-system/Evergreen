= Bibliographic Records (Record Details) =
:toc:

Each item in the catalog is linked to a bibliographic record. This record contains detailed information about the item. You can also perform a number of actions from a bibliographic record.

Access an item's bibliographic record by finding the item in the _Staff Catalog_, then selecting the item's title or cover image. 

You may also access an item's record by clicking its title any time it is hyperlinked, such as on a patron's account or on the _Item Status_ page.

There may be multiple records for a given title if the title has multiple editions, formats, or publishers in your catalog. Differences in cataloging practices between libraries could also result in multiple records for the same title. 

[TIP]
====
Select _Show Search Form_ in the top-right corner of a bibliographic record page to display the search form. If the search form is displayed, the button will say _Hide Search Form_. Select this button to hide the search form.

The search form is filled by information in your URL. This information will still be present in the search form if you accessed the record from a search results page or by selecting a link that contained search information.
