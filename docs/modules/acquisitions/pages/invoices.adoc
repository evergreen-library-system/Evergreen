indexterm:[acquisitions,invoices]

You can create invoices for purchase orders, individual line items, and blanket purchases. You can also link existing invoices to purchase orders. Additionaly, you can add specific line items to an invoice from the purchase order or acquisitions search results screen. You can also search for relevant line items from within the invoices interface. You can also add all line items from an entire purchase order to an invoice or you can create a blanket invoice for items that are not  attached to a purchase order.

You can invoice items before you receive the items if desired. You can also reopen closed invoices, and you can print invoices.

== Creating invoices ==

To create a new blank invoice, navigate to *Acquisitions -> Create Invoice*.

Invoices are laid out in three main sections from top to bottom.

The first section is the summary section.

image::invoices/invoice_summary.png[Invoice summary section]

The summary section contains the following fields, some for entry and other which are read-only:

* _Vendor Invoice ID_ (required) - This number may be listed on the paper invoice sent from your vendor, or may be an internal identifier. This field must be unique.
* _Provider_ (required) - Select a provider, if this field is empty. If you have created an invoice from a purchase order this field will be generated from the purchase order and is entered by default.
* _Shipper_ (required) - This defaults to the provider that was entered in the provider field.
* _Receive Method_ (required) - Select a receive method. The system will default to _Paper_.
* _Receiver_ (required) - The receiver defaults to the branch at which your workstation is registered. You can change the receiver by selecting a different org unit.
*_Invoice Type_ (optional) - This is a free text field.
* _Payment Method_ (optional) - Select a payment method. Payment methods are set in xref:acquisitions_admin.adoc#_invoice_payment_method[Acquisitions Administration].
* _Payment Auth_ (optional) - This is a free text field.
* _Note_ (optional) - This is a free text field.
* _Invoice Date_ (required) - This default as the date that you create the invoice. You can change the date by clicking in the field or using the calendar picker.
* _Close Date_ - This will show the date an invoice was closed. It is empty in the case of an open invoice.
* _Closed By_ - This will show the staff member who closed the invoice. It is empty in the case of an open invoice.
* _Saved Data Summary_ - After saving an invoice, this section will show the current total billed, total encumbrances, total paid, and balance owed of all invoice items.
* _Fund Summary_ - After an invoice is closed, this will show the totals for each fund billed in the invoice.

The next section is the line items section. This section also contains tabs to navigate to batch receive, search, and print preview.

image::invoices/invoice_line_items.png[Invoice line items section]

When this section is populated with line items, you can use the filter and sort options or expand / collapse all or selected line items. For more information on these filter and sort options, please see the xref:selection_lists_po.adoc#line_item_batch_actions[Line Items documentation].

Along with the title and author of the line items is a summary of copies ordered, received, invoiced, claimed, and cancelled. You can also view the amounts estimated, encumbered, and paid for each line item. Finally, each line item has a line item ID, and links to the selection list (if used) and the purchase order. In the example below, the line item ID is 563 and the purchase order is 71. There is no selection list on this example.

image::invoices/invoice_line_items_expanded.png[Line item details on the invoice]

Evergreen automatically enters the number of items that were ordered in the _# Invoiced_ and _# Paid_ fields. You  may adjust these quantities as needed.

Evergreen will also pull over line item prices from the purchase order. If you need to change this amount, enter the amount that the organization was billed. This entry will automatically propagate to the _Paid_ field. The _Per Copy_ field calculates the cost of each copy by dividing the amount that was billed by the number of copies for which the library paid.

If you wish to detach an existing line item from an invoice, select the _Detach_ button to the right of the paid fields.

image::invoices/invoice_detach.png[Detach a line item from an invoice]

The line item styling will update to show a dashed black border. If you wish to reattach the item, click 
_Reattach_. The detatched status will not be saved until you select the _Save_ button at the top or bottom of the invoice.

image::invoices/invoice_reattach.png[Reattach a line item to an invoice]

The last section of the invoice page is the direct charges section. You have the option to add charge types if applicable. Charge types are additional charges that can be selected from the drop-down menu. Common charge types include taxes and handling fees. This is also the section where you would create a blanket invoice, so documentation for this section is below in xref:invoices.adoc#create_blanket_invoice[Creating a blanket invoice].

You can edit direct charges as long as the invoice is open. Any changes to direct charges will not be saved until you select _Save_ at the top or bottom of the invoice.

[[li_search_from_invoice]]
=== Search for line items from an invoice ===

You can open an invoice, search for line items from the invoice, and add your search results to a new or existing invoice. This feature is especially useful when you want to populate an invoice with line items from multiple purchase orders.

. Navigate to _Acquisitions_ -> _Create Invoice_, or open an existing invoice.
. Select the _Search_ tab to add line items to an invoice.
. Search criteria will default to the following:
.. Item Count is greater than or equal to 1
.. Line Item Status is not cancelled
.. Line Item Provider is equal to the Provider selected in the invoice, if the _Limit to Invoiceable Items_ checkbox is selected.
. Add additional search search criteria if you wish.
. The _Limit to Invoiceable Items_ checkbox is selected by default. 
+
[NOTE]
Invoiceable items are those that are on order, have not been cancelled, and have not yet been invoiced. Evergreen also filters out items that have already been added to an invoice. Finally, if this box is checked, and if your entered the invoice details at the top of the screen.
+
. The _Keep results between searches_ checkbox is deselected by default. When this checkbox is deselected, new search results will replace previous results in the grid. Check this box for the search results list to build with each subsequent search. This option is useful for libraries that might search for line items by scanning an ISBN. Several ISBNs can be scanned and then the entire result set can be selected and moved to the invoice in a batch.
. Once you have your search criteria established, select the _Search_ button.
+
image::invoices/invoice_li_search.png[Search for lineitems from an invoice]
+
. By default, results are sorted by line item number. Click on column headers to change the sort.
. Select one or many line item(s) to add to your invoice. The rows that you selected will be highlighted.
. Once you have selected all desired line items from your search results, click the button _Add Selected Items to Invoice_. 
. Select the _Invoice Line Items_ tab to return to the main invoice view.
. Evergreen automatically enters the number of items that were ordered and their prices in the _# Invoiced_, _# Paid_, _Billed_, and _Paid_ fields. Adjust these quantities as needed.
- Note that if the _Billed_ and _Paid_ fields come over as null, you can enter a billed price that will propagate to the paid price. Changes to non-null values will not propagate between these fields.
. The _Price Per Item_ field calculates the cost of each copy by dividing the amount that was billed by the number of copies for which the library paid.

[[create_invoice_from_po]]
=== Create an invoice from a purchase order ===

You can create an invoice for all of the line items on a purchase order, after the purchase order is activated. 

. Navigate to a purchase order.
. From the purchase order summary, you have three options to create an invoice:
- _Create Invoice_ - this creates an invoice from all line items + direct charges. Line item prices will carry over, but direct charge prices will not.
- _Create Invoice with PO prices_ - this creates an invoice from all line items + direct charges, including prices for line items and direct charges.
- _Legacy Create Invoice_ - this opens the legacy (Dojo) invoices interface. This interface is no longer actively being maintained. You will only see this option if you have the Library Setting _Display Links to Deprecated Acquisitions Interfaces_ set to TRUE for your workstation location.
. Once you are in the invoice interface, follow the instructions listed above under xref:invoices.adoc#creating_invoices[Creating Invoices].
. You have four options for saving an invoice.
- Select _Save_ to save the changes you have made while staying in the current invoice. If your invoice will exceed the fund warning or fund stop balance, you will see a warning to that effect. If you exceed the stop balance, you will need to correct the overage before saving the invoice.
- Select _New Invoice_ to save the changes you have made and to replace the current invoice with a new invoice so that you can continue invoicing items.
- Select _Prorate_ to save the invoice and prorate any additional charges, such as taxes, across funds, if multiple funds have been used to pay the invoice.
+
[NOTE]
Prorating will only be applied to charge types that have the _Prorate?_ flag set to true. This setting can be adjusted via _Administration_ -> _Acquisitions Administration_ -> _Invoice Item Types_.
+
- Select _Close Invoice_. Choose this option when you have completed the invoice. This option will also save any changes that have been made. Funds will be disencumbered when the invoice is closed.
. You can re-open a closed invoice by selecting the _Re-open invoice_ button. This button appears on closed invoices.

[[create_blanket_invoice]]
=== Creating a blanket invoice ===

You can create a blanket invoice for purchases that are not attached to a purchase order.

. Navigate to _Acquisitions_ -> _Create invoice_.
. Enter the invoice information in the top part of the screen.
. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to the section labeled _Direct Charges, Taxes, Fees, etc._ and select the _New Charge_ button.
- This functionality may also be used to add shipping, tax, and other fees.
. Select a charge type from the drop-down menu. This field is required.
+
[NOTE]
New charge types can be added via _Administration_ -> _Acquisitions Administration_ -> _Invoice Item Types_.
+
. Select a fund from the drop-down menu. This field is required for all non-proratable charge types.
- Charge types that are proratable will be not be permitted to select a fund, since they will be prorated across all funds on the invoice.
+
[NOTE]
There is a known issue with prorated fund types. Since purchase orders require all direct charges to have a fund type, even proratable funds, invoices do not permit a fund selection for proratable charge types. The latter is the correct behavior, but be aware that this can cause a discrepancy in the invoice summary calculation.
+  
. Enter a _Title/Description_ of the resource, if applicable.
. Enter an _Author_, if applicable.
. Enter a _Note_, if applicable.
. Enter the amount that you were billed. This field is required.

This feature enables users to receive items from an invoice. Staff can receive individual copies, or they can receive items in batch. As of Evergreen *VERSION*, these interfaces are combined.

You can choose per line item whether you want to receive a count of items on an line item (formerly known as list mode, or batch mode), or receive specific items (formerly known as numeric mode). The latter is helpful if you have vendor-provided barcodes on incoming items.

You can also choose to receive all line items in the page, or all line items on the invoice.

. Select the _Batch Receive_tab.
. For each line item, you can choose to receive any or all items.
.. To receive all items on a line item, select the checkbox next to the line item title.
