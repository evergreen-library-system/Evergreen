== Selection Lists ==

Selection lists allow you to create, manage, and save lists of items
that you may want to purchase. To view your selection list, click
*Acquisitions* -> *My Selection Lists*. Use the general search to view selection lists created by other users.

=== Create a selection list ===

Selection lists can be created in four areas within the module. Selection lists can be created when you xref:#brief_records[Add Brief Records], Upload MARC Order Records, or find records through the xref:#marc_federated_search[MARC Federated Search]. In each of these interfaces, you will find the Add to Selection List field. Enter the name of the selection list that you want to create in that field.

Selection lists can also be created through the My Selection Lists interface:

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *My Selection Lists*.
. Click the New Selection List drop down arrow.
. Enter the name of the selection list in the box that appears.
. Click Create.

=== Add items to a selection list ===

You can add items to a selection list in one of three ways: xref:#brief_records[add a brief record]; upload MARC order records; add records through a xref:#marc_federated_search[federated search]; or use the View/Place Orders menu item in the catalog.

=== Clone selection lists ===

Cloning selection lists enables you to copy one selection list into a new selection list. You can maintain both copies of the list, or you can delete the previous list.

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *My Selection Lists*.
. Check the box adjacent to the list that you want to clone.
. Click Clone Selected.
. Enter a name into the box that appears, and click Clone.

=== Merge selection lists ===

You can merge two or more selection lists into one selection list.


. Click *Acquisitions* -> *My Selection Lists*.
. Check the boxes adjacent to the selection lists that you want to merge, and click Merge Selected.
. Choose the Lead Selection List from the drop down menu. This is the list to which the items on the other list(s) will be transferred.
. Click Merge.

=== Delete selection lists ===

You can delete selection lists that you do not want to save. You will not be able to retrieve these items through the General Search after you have deleted the list. You must delete all line items from a selection list before you can delete the list.


. Click *Acquisitions* -> *My Selection Lists*.
. Check the box adjacent to the selection list(s) that you want to delete.
. Click Delete Selected.

=== Mark Ready for Selector ===

After an item has been added to a selection list or purchase order, you can mark it ready for selector. This step is optional but may be useful to individual workflows.


. If you want to mark part of a selection list ready for selector, then you can check the box(es) of the line item(s) that you wish to mark ready for selector. If you want to mark the entire list ready for selector, then skip to step 2.
. Click *Actions* -> *Mark Ready for Selector*.
. A pop up box will appear. Choose to mark the selected line items or all line items.
. Click Go.
. The screen will refresh. The marked line item(s) will be highlighted pink, and the status changes to selector-ready.

=== Convert selection list to purchase order ===

Use the Actions menu to convert a selection list to a purchase order.


. From a selection list, click *Actions* -> *Create Purchase Order*.
. A pop up box will appear.
. Select the ordering agency from the drop down menu.
. Enter the provider.
. Check the box adjacent to prepayment required if prepayment is required.
. Choose if you will add All Lineitems or Selected Lineitems to your purchase order.
. Check the box if you want to Import Bibs and Create Copies in the catalog.
. Click Submit.


[#purchase_orders]
== Purchase Orders ==

Purchase Orders allow you to keep track of orders and, if EDI is enabled, communicate with your provider.
To view purchase orders, click
*Acquisitions* -> *Purchase Orders*.

=== Naming your purchase order ===

You can give your purchase order a name.

When creating a purchase order or editing an existing purchase order, the purchase order name must be unique for the ordering agency.  Evergreen will display a warning dialog to users, if they attempt to create or edit purchase order names that match the names of already existing purchase orders at the same ordering agency. The *Duplicate Purchase Order Name Warning Dialog* includes a link that will open the matching purchase order in a new tab.

Purchase Order Names are case sensitive.

*Duplicate PO Name Detection When Creating a New Purchase Order*

image::media/po_name_detection_1.JPG[PO Name Detection 1]

When a duplicate purchase order name is detected during the creation of a new purchase order, the user may:

* Click *View PO* to view the purchase order with the matching name. The purchase order will open in a new tab.
* Click *Cancel* to cancel the creation of the new purchase order.
* Within the _Name (optional)_ field, enter a different, unique name for the new purchase order.

If the purchase order name is unique for the ordering agency, the user will continue filling in the remaining fields and click *Save*.

If the purchase order name is not unique for the ordering agency, the Save button will remain grayed out to the user until the purchase order is given a unique name.

*Duplicate PO Name Detection When Editing the Name of an Existing Purchase Order*

To change the name of an existing purchase order:

. Within the purchase order, the _Name_ of the purchase order is a link (located at the top left-hand side of the purchase order). Click the PO Name.
. A new window will open, where users can rename the purchase order.
. Enter the new purchase order name.
. Click *OK*.

image::media/po_name_detection_2.JPG[PO Name Detection 2]

If the new purchase order name is unique for the ordering agency, the purchase order will be updated to reflect the new name.
If the purchase order name is not unique for the ordering agency, the purchase order will not be updated with the new name. Instead, the user will see the *Duplicate Purchase Order Name Warning Dialog* within the purchase order.

image::media/po_name_detection_3.JPG[PO Name Detection 3]

When a duplicate purchase order name is detected during the renaming of an existing purchase order, the user may:

* Click *View PO* to view the purchase order with the matching name. The purchase order will open in a new tab.
* Repeat the steps to change the name of an existing purchase order and make the name unique.

=== Activating your purchase order ===

When the appropriate criteria have been met the Activate Order button will appear and you can proceed with the following:

. Click the button Activate Order.
. When you activate the order the bibliographic records and copies will be imported into the catalog using the Vandelay interface, if not previously imported. See How to Load Bibliographic Records and Items into the Catalog for instructions on using the Vandelay interface.
. The funds associated with the purchases will be encumbered.

After you click *Activate Order*, you will be presented with the record import interface for records that are not already in the catalog. Once you complete entering in the parameters for the record import interface, the progress screen will appear. As of Evergreen 2.9, this progress screen consists of a progress bar in the foreground, and a tally of the following in the background of the bottom-left corner:

* Lineitems processed
* Vandelay Records processed
* Bib Records Merged/Imported
* ACQ Copies Processed
* Debits Encumbered
* Real Copies Processed

==== Activate Purchase Order without loading items ====

It is possible to activate a purchase order without loading items. Once the purchase order has been activated without loading items, it is not possible to load the items. This feature should only be used in situations where the copies have already been added to the catalog, such as:

* Cleaning up pre-acquisitions backlog
* Direct purchases that have already been cataloged

To use this feature, click the Activate Without Loading Items button.

==== Activate Purchase Order with Zero Copies ====

By default, a purchase order cannot be activated if a line item on the
purchase order has zero copies. To activate a purchase order with line
items that have zero copies, check the box *Allow activation with
zero-copy lineitems*.

image::media/Zero_Copies1.jpg[Zero_Copies1]

=== Line item statuses ===

The purchase orders interface keeps track of various statuses that your
line items might be in.  This section lists some of the statuses you might
see when looking at purchase orders.

==== Canceled and Delayed Items ====

In the purchase order interface, you can easily
differentiate between canceled and delayed items.  Each label begins
with *Canceled* or *Delayed*.  To view the list, click *Administration*
-> *Acquisitions Administration* -> *Cancel Reasons*.

The cancel/delay reason label is displayed as the line item status in the list of line items or as the copy status in the list of copies.

image::media/2_7_Enhancements_to_Canceled2.jpg[Canceled2]


image::media/2_7_Enhancements_to_Canceled4.jpg[Canceled4]

A delayed line item can now be canceled.  You can mark a line item as delayed, and if later, the order cannot be filled, you can change the line item's status to canceled.  When delayed line items are canceled, the encumbrances are deleted.

Cancel/delay reasons now appear on the worksheet and the printable purchase order.

[NOTE]
========================
When all the copies of a line item are canceled through the Acquisitions interface,
the parent lineitem is also canceled. The cancel reason will be calculated based
on the settings of:
  
. The cancel reason for the last copy to be canceled copy if the cancel reason's
_Keep Debits_ setting is true.
. The cancel reason for any other copy on the line item if the cancel reason's
_Keep Debits_ setting is true.
. The cancel reason for the last copy to be canceled if no copies on the line
item have a cancel reason where _Keep Debits_ is true.
========================


==== Paid PO Line Items ====

Purchase Order line items are marked as "Paid" in red text when all non-cancelled copies on the line item have been invoiced.

[#brief_records]
== Brief Records ==

Brief records are short bibliographic records with minimal information that are often used as placeholder records until items are received.

You can add brief records to new, pending or on-order purchase orders.

=== Add brief records to a selection list ===

[#line_items]
== Line Items ==

=== Return to Line Item ===

This feature enables you to return to a specific line item on a selection list,
purchase order, or invoice after you have navigated away from the page that
contained the line item.  This feature is especially useful when you must
identify a line item in a long list. After working with a line item, you can
return to your place in the search results or the list of line items.

To use this feature, select a line item, and then, depending on the location of
the line item, click *Return* or *Return to search*.  Evergreen will take you
back to the specific line item in your search and highlight the line item with a
colored box.

For example, you retrieve a selection list, find a line item to examine, and
click the *Copies* link.  After editing the copies, you click *Return*.
Evergreen takes you back to your selection list and highlights the line item
that you viewed. 

image::media/Return_to_line_item1.jpg[Return_to_line_item1]

This feature is available in _General Search Results_, _Purchase Orders_, and
_Selection Lists_, whenever any of the following links are available: 

* Selection List
* Purchase Order
* Copies
* Notes
* Worksheet

This feature is available in Invoices whenever any of the following links are
available:

* Title
* Selection List
* Purchase Order

=== Display a Count of Existing Copies on Selection List and Purchase Order Lineitems ===

When displaying Acquisitions lineitems within the Selection List and Purchase Order interfaces, Evergreen displays a count of existing catalog copies on the lineitem. The count of existing catalog copies refers to the number of copies owned at the ordering agency and / or the ordering agency's child organization units.

The counts display for lineitems that have a direct link to a catalog record. Generally, this includes lineitems created as "on order" based on an existing catalog record and lineitems where "Load Bibs and Items" has been applied.

The count of existing copies does not include copies that are in either a Lost or a Missing status.

The existing copy count displays in the link "bar" located below the Order Identifier within the lineitem.

If no existing copies are found, a "0" (zero) will display in plain text.

If the existing copy count is greater than zero, then the count will display in bold and red on the lineitem.

The user may also hover over the existing copy count to view the accompanying tooltip.
