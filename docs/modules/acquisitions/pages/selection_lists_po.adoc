= Line Items, Selection Lists, and Purchase Orders =
:toc:

This documentation covers line items, selection lists, purchase orders, brief records, and MARC federated search.

Most of the above were converted to Angular in the 3.10 release of Evergreen. Please refer to earlier versions of the documentation if you use Evergreen 3.9 or prior.

== Dojo vs. Angular interfaces in Acquisitions ==

Since the work to convert Acquisitions to Angular is an ongoing, multi-part project, there may be an occasion where you will still end up in the old Dojo view of a selection list or purchase order. To navigate directly to the Angular view of a selection list or purchase order, use this URL pattern:

* Selection List: `https://<your-evergreen-domain>/eg2/<locale>/staff/acq/picklist/<selection-list-number>`
* Purchase Order: `https://<your-evergreen-domain>/eg2/<locale>/staff/acq/po/29<purchase-order-number>`

Locale is the localization setting for your staff client. If you are in the United States, this is probably en-US. In Canada this may be en-CA or fr-CA depending on whether your client uses English or French.

If you wish to allow staff to access the old Dojo view of purchase orders, there is a new Library Setting to control this. This setting is _Display Links to Deprecated Acquisitions Interfaces_, and it is disabled by default. If enabled, this will expose a link in the purchase order at the organizational unit(s) specified in the setting. Selecting this link will open a new tab with the purchase order displayed in Dojo.

You may also need to reauthenticate when accessing a Dojo interface, though every effort has been made to find and rectify these cases during development.

[[line_items]]
== Line Items ==

The Evergreen Acquisitions module uses line items to represent individual bibliographic titles to order on both purchase orders and selection lists. Line items include a large amount of information, including styling to show you where a line item is in the ordering process, and links to other order information.

Line items can be searched from the Acquisitions General Search which is accessed from *Acquisitions -> General Search*.

Line items convey a lot of information, which is described in detail in the following sections. An example of a line item is shown below.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_line_item.png[Acquisitions Line Item]

[[line_item_defaults]]
=== Line Item Defaults: Owning Library ===

There are two new Library Settings related to ownership of automatically created items. These settings apply to items created as the result of the Provider Default Number of Copies setting.

* How to set default owning library for auto-created line item items
** Strategy to use to set default owning library to set when line item items are auto-created because the provider's default copy count has been set.
** Valid values are "workstation" to use the workstation library, "blank" to leave it blank, and "use_setting" to use the "Default owning library for auto-created line item items" setting. If not set, the workstation library will be used.
* Default owning library for auto-created line item items
** The default owning library to set when line item items are auto-created because the provider's default copy count has been set. This applies if the "How to set default owning library for auto-created line item items" setting is set to "use_setting".
** Note that due to a pre-existing bug, this setting will display the organizational unit ID when displayed in the larger Library Settings grid; but the selector itself uses organizational unit Shortname.

[[line_item_colors]]
=== Line Item Colors and Statuses ===

At various points in the ordering process, selection lists and purchase orders will display line items with a colored background as a visual shorthand indicating the status of the line item. Those colors are as follows:

++++
<style>
td.tableblock .FFFFEE p {
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 238);
}
td.tableblock .FFEEEE p {

The line item status is affected by the status(es) of all items attached to the line item. While items do not have a separate status field per se, they can have implicit statuses such as new, pending, received, or canceled.

When an item is canceled, the parent line item is checked to see if all of its items are now canceled. If so, the line item is canceled. Delayed items represent a special case of canceled items. For more information on canceled and delayed line items, see xref:selection_lists_po.adoc#canceling_or_delaying_line_items[Canceling or Delaying Line Items], below.

When all items associated with a line item are received, the parent line item is marked received. While items are in a mixed set of statues (e.g., some delayed and some received), the line item status will remain as on order.

A purchase order is marked received once all of its line items are marked either as received, or as canceled with a non-keep-debits reason.

[[line_item_batch_actions]]
=== Line Item Batch Actions ===

Line items show a large amount of detail about the titles and items that are in various stages of the Acquisitions process. Line items are filterable and sortable. You can perform actions on a single line item, several line items, or all line items. You can also expand the line item display to show details of a single line item or all line items.

For specific selection list actions, see the documentation covering xref:acquisitions:selection_lists_po.adoc#selection_lists[Selection Lists]. For specific purchase order actions, see xref:acquisitions:selection_lists_po.adoc#purchase_order_actions[Purchase Order Actions]. Below we will describe Line Item Batch Actions that apply to both selection lists and purchase orders.

[[expand_line_item_display]]
==== Expand Line Item Display ====

You can expand the line item display to show item details including
Owning Branch, Shelving Location, Collection Code, Fund, Circ Modifier, Call Number, Barcode, and Receiver (if applicable).

To show this expanded information for a single line item or several line items, select the link labeled _Expand_ on the line item(s). The label will flip to _Collapse_, and you can select _Collapse_ to hide the expanded information.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_expand_line_items.png[Expand Line Items]

To show this expanded information for all line items, select the _Expand All_ icon at the top right of the list. To hide this expanded information for all line items, select the _Collapse All_ icon at the top right of the list. The current state of Expand All / Collapse All will be carried over to each page of your purchase order or selection list.

. Select your filter element in the first dropdown. Filter elements
include:
.. Line Item ID
.. Status
.. Title
.. Author
.. Publisher
.. Publication date
.. ISBN
.. ISSN
.. UPC
.. Claim count
.. Item count
.. Estimated unit price
. Select your operator in the second dropdown. Operators will vary depending on your selected filter element, but can include the following:
.. Is [i.e., equals - this is case sensitive]
.. Is NOT [i.e., does not equal - this is case sensitive]
.. Contains [i.e., contains string - this is not case sensitive]
.. STARTS with [i.e., beginning string - this is not case sensitive]
.. ENDS with [i.e., ending string - this is not case sensitive]
.. Claim Count and Item Count filter elements also include numeric operators “greater than or equal to” and “less than or equal to”
. Enter your filter value in the third dropdown. Some operators expect numeric or case-specific values (see above).
. Select *Apply Filter* to filter your list, or press the ENTER key on your keyboard. At this time only one filter may be in operation at a time.
. Select *Reset Filter* to clear the filter.

To set a sort order for your list, choose a sort order from the dropdown labeled _Sort by_. Sort will be instantly applied to all items in the purchase order or selection list. Sorting is currently only available on a single axis. Once you select a sort order, it is sticky across purchase orders and selection lists until you change to a new sort order.

Sort options are:

* Line Item ID Ascending
* Line Item ID Descending
* Title Ascending
** Sorts by the value in the 245$a field in the line item bibliographic detail, ignoring initial articles.
* Title Descending
** Sorts by the value in the 245$a field in the line item bibliographic detail, ignoring initial articles.
* Author Ascending
** Sorts by the value as entered in the 1xx$a field in the line item bibliographic detail: “Author, Ima” will sort before “Ima Author”.
* Author Descending
** Sorts by the value as entered in the 1xx$a field in the line item bibliographic detail: “Author, Ima” will sort after “Ima Author”.
* Publisher Ascending
** Sorts by the value as entered in the 260$b field in the line item bibliographic detail, including initial articles.
* Publisher Descending
** Sorts by the value as entered in the 260$b field in the line item bibliographic detail, including initial articles.
* Order Identifier Ascending
** This is ISBN, ISSN, or UPC as assigned in the line item order identifier field
* Order Identifier Descending
** This is ISBN, ISSN, or UPC as assigned in the line item order identifier field

[[item_details_interface]]
==== Item Details Interface ====

The Item Details interface is where you add individual items to a line item.

To access the Item Details interface, open a selection list or purchase order and navigate to the line item you’re interested in. Select the _Items_ link.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_line_item_details.png[Line Item Details]

From within the Item Details interface you can add items to the line item by entering the number of items you wish to add and then selecting *Apply*. This will append items to your line item.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_line_item_details_interface.png[Line Item Details Interface]

Details available in the interface include:

* Owning Branch
* Shelving Location
* Collection Code
* Fund
** All items must be assigned a fund for a purchase order to be activated.
** Funds in this interface will be color coded yellow if they have exceeded their warning percent, and red if they are at or above their stop percent. Note that this may cause slowness issues for libraries with a large number of active funds.
* Circ Modifier

You will see any existing notes or alerts as well as an option to create a new note or alert.

Notes are free text and if you are using EDI they can be sent to the vendor by selecting the Vendor Public checkbox. For non-EDI orders, notes would need to be manually entered on the vendor’s ordering site.

Alerts are chosen from a dropdown. An alert will create a pop up notice when an item with an alert is received. Alert values are set in xref:admin:acquisitions_admin.adoc#create_a_line_item_alert[Acquisitions Administration].

To delete a line item alert, select Delete on the right hand side. You will not get a confirmation dialog, so make sure you really want to delete the note or alert!

Line item alerts are displayed when receiving a line item on a purchase order.

[[line_item_actions]]
==== Line Item Actions ====

Each line item has an _Actions_ button.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_line_item_actions.png[Line Item Actions Button]

Selecting this button will show the *Line Item Actions Menu*. You will see all actions in both the selection list and purchase order interface, and regardless of the status of your line item. Actions which are unavailable will be disabled.

Line item actions include:

* _Mark Received_ - this marks the line item and all of its individual items as Received
* _Mark Un-Received_ - this marks the line item and all of its individual items as Un-Received

.. _Price_ must contain a numeric value and will map to the line item price field
. 
Select *Add Record* when you are finished filling out the form. You will be returned to your selection list and a new line item will be created with information from your brief record.

[[mark_ready_for_selector]]
=== Mark Ready for Selector ===

After a line item has been added to a selection list or purchase order, you can mark it as _Ready for Selector_. A selector can then search for line items with the status _Selector Ready_ for review and approval. This step is optional but may be useful to individual workflows, specifically those workflows where a library divides responsibility between the staff member who builds a selection list and the staff member who approves those items and sends them on to a purchase order.

. Open the selection list.
. Choose line items to mark Selector Ready.
.. Option A: If you only want to mark some line items as Selector Ready, select individual line items using the checkboxes on each line. You can also use the _Line Items in Page_ to select all line items in your current page.
.. Option B: If you want to mark all line items as Selector Ready, use the _All Line Items_ checkbox to select all line items in the selection list.
. Select the _Actions_ button in the upper left of the interface.
. Choose *Mark Selected Line Items as Ready for Selector*.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_mark_ready_for_selector.png[Action: Mark Ready for Selector]
+
. You will be presented with a confirmation dialog. Choose *Confirm* to mark the line items as Selector Ready or choose *Cancel* to exit without marking line items as Selector Ready.
. The marked line item(s) will be highlighted pink, and their status will change to Selector-Ready.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_selector_ready.png[Selector Ready Line Item]
+
. Once a Selector has reviewed the line items, they can either send them to a purchase order (see following section) or navigate to *Actions -> Mark Selected Line Items as Ready for Order* as an intermediate step.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_mark_ready_for_order.png[Action: Mark Ready for Order]
. This action will update selected line item(s) to a status of Order Ready but it will not automatically add them to a purchase order.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_order_ready.png[Order Ready Line Item]

[[send_selection_list_to_po]]
=== Send Selection List Line Items to Purchase Order ===

Use the actions menu to send a selection list or its line items to a purchase order.

. Open the selection list.
. Choose line items to send to a purchase order.
.. Option A: If you only want to send some line items to a purchase order, select individual line items using the checkboxes on each line. You can also use the _Line Items in Page_ checkbox to select all line items in your current page, or the _All Line Items_ checkbox to select all line items in the selection list.
... Select the _Actions_ button in the upper left of the interface.
... Choose *Create Purchase Order From Selected Line Items*.
.. Option B: If you want to send all line items to a purchase order, you do not need to preselect items.
... Select the _Actions_ button in the upper left of the interface.
... Choose *Create Purchase Order From All Line Items*.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_create_po_from_line_items.png[Action: Create Purchase Order from Line Items]
. You will be taken to a Create Purchase Order interface, with the
following fields:
.. _Ordering Agency_ (required) - the organizational unit that owns the purchase order. This does not need to be the same as the organizational unit that created the selection list.
... This dropdown will only show locations allowed by your working location and permissions
.. _Name_ - the name of the purchase order. If you leave this field blank, the purchase order name will be the same as the autogenerated purchase order number.
.. _Provider_ (required) - the Provider who will be supplying the order.
.. _Prepayment Required_ - check this box to indicate that the purchase order requires prepayment.
.. _Import Bibs and Create Copies_ - check this box to import on-order bibs and items into the catalog when you create the purchase order.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_create_po.png[Create Purchase Order Form]
+
. Once you have filled out the fields, click *Create*.
.. If you did not select _Import Bibs and Create Copies_, you will be taken to the purchase order interface and all line items will be in the status Pending-Order.
.. If you did select _Import Bibs and Create Copies_, you will be presented with a record import interface to import records from a file at the time of your purchase order creation.
... This interface is similar to the xref:cataloging:batch_importing_MARC.adoc[MARC Batch Import/Export] and xref:acquisitions:vandelay_acquisitions_integration.adoc[Load MARC Order Records] interfaces. Please see documentation about those interfaces for more information.
... Once you have loaded your records, you will see your purchase order with all line items in the status Pending-Order.

You can only link selection list line items to one purchase order. If you attempt to create a purchase order from selection list line items that are already part of a purchase order, those line items will be ignored when creating the purchase order and you will see the following warning message in the Create Purchase Order interface:

image::selection_lists_po/acq_add_items_to_multiple_PO.png[Create Purchase Order Warning]

After you create your purchase order, if you navigate back to your selection list you will see that all line items sent to a purchase order are marked Pending-Order. The selection list will continue to update line items as they move through the Acquisitions process.

[[naming_purchase_order]]
=== Naming a Purchase Order ===

You can choose to give your purchase order a name. If you don’t give your purchase order a name, the system ID number will be used as the purchase order name.

When creating a purchase order or editing an existing purchase order, the purchase order name must be unique for the ordering agency. Evergreen will display a warning to users if they attempt to create or edit purchase order names that match the names of already existing purchase orders at the same ordering agency.

Purchase order names are case sensitive.

[[duplicate_po_name_creation]]
==== Duplicate PO Name Detection When Creating a New Purchase Order ====

image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_duplicate_name.png[Duplicate Purchase Order Name Warning]

When a duplicate purchase order name is detected during the creation of a new purchase order, you will be given an alert, shown above. Select *View PO* to view the purchase order with the matching name. The purchase order will open in a new tab.

Return to the Create Purchase Order tab, and within the _Name (optional)_ field, enter a different, unique name for the new purchase order.

Other actions related to purchase orders are accessible via the _Actions_ button. Actions related to purchase orders in this menu
include:

* _Load Bibs and Items_ - if your purchase order is still in a Pending state and contains titles which are not already in your catalog, you can select this to open an interface to load bibs and items into the catalog.
** Loading parameters include templates, matching options, and quality parameters in the same manner that the regular MARC Batch Import tool uses.
** This will create records and items based on the information already included with the line items. For example, if your line items only contain brief record information, this is what will be loaded into the catalog.
** Once you complete entering in the parameters for the record import interface, select *Submit*. A progress bar will appear and the purchase order screen will refresh when the load is complete.
** *NOTE*: Activating an order will also load bibs and items, unless you choose to activate the order without loading items.

All of these actions, except _Load Bibs and Items_, will be applied to selected line items. You can select one, several, or all line items.

Actions that apply to line items regardless of whether they are in a selection list or purchase order are detailed above, under xref:acquisitions:selection_lists_po.adoc#line_item_actions[Line Item Actions].

[[add_line_items_to_po]]
=== Adding Line Items to a Purchase Order ===

If you created your purchase order from a selection list or from the xref:acquisitions:vandelay_acquisitions_integration.adoc[Load MARC Order Records] interface, your purchase order will already have line item information listed.

To add individual line items from within a purchase order:

. Open the purchase order
. Select the _Actions_ button in the upper left of the interface
. Choose *Add Brief Record*
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_new_brief_record.png[Action: Add New Brief Record]

.. There is an open bug on the _Identifier_ field and it is recommended that you skip this field
.. _Price_ must contain a numeric value and will map to the line item price field
. Select *Add Record* when you are finished filling out the form. You will be returned to your purchase order and a new line item will be created with information from your brief record.

You can also add line items to a purchase order from other interfaces:

* In the staff catalog bibliographic record, from the View/Place Orders menu item
** Note that this will put you in the old Dojo interface and you will need to know the name of your existing purchase order to enter it in the typeahead.
* Load Catalog Record IDs interface
* MARC Federated Search interface

[[direct_charges]]
=== Direct Charges ===

You can add direct charges to a purchase order. Direct charges are not associated with individual line items, but rather with the purchase order itself. You can add one or several direct charges to a purchase order. If a direct charge is directly linked to an invoice charge, the state of the invoice charge controls how the fund debit is handled.

Direct charges can be created for taxes, shipping fees, handling fees, blanket orders, or other reasons. To create a new direct charge, scroll to the bottom of the purchase order and select *New Charge*.

* _Charge Type_ (required) - the type of direct charge
** Direct charge types are set in xref:admin:acquisitions_admin.adoc#_invoice_item_type[Acquisitions Administration -> Invoice Item Types]
* _Fund_ (required) - the fund to which the charge is assigned
* _Title / Description_ - a free text field describing the direct charge
* _Author_ - if an author is associated with the direct charge, enter that information here
* _Note_ - a free text note associated with the direct charge
* _Estimated Cost_ (required) - the estimated cost of the charge.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_direct_charge.png[Direct Charges]

Select *Save* to save your direct charge. Direct charges will appear on an invoice that you create from the purchase order.

You can edit an existing direct charge by selecting _Edit_, or remove an existing direct charge by selecting _Remove_. You will not be asked to confirm removing a direct charge, so only select Remove if you are sure you want to remove the direct charge.

There are circumstances where a direct charge will be debited from a different fund than the one originally entered - e.g., prorating a charge can do this; or where the debited amount be different - e.g., proration, or the invoice charge simply having a different amount. The direct charges list now can display that information in the estimated cost column. The amount actually expended will be labeled _Amount Expended_.

There is a _Disencumber Charge_ button which will be visible under
select circumstances:

* The purchase order is active (or received) but not canceled
* The fund debit is not already zero
* The fund debit is not already linked to an invoice

To see how direct charges are used with blanket orders, see the xref:acquisitions:blanket.adoc[Blanket Orders] documentation.

[[activating_purchase_order]]
=== Activating a Purchase Order ===

Typically, for a purchase order to be activated, all line items must have items attached. Line items must have a price and be assigned to a fund. If any of these elements are missing, or if there is another reason the purchase order cannot be activated, the purchase order _Status_ will indicate the reason the purchase order cannot be activated.

*NOTE:* Line item prices may not be null, but they can be set to zero.

*NOTE:* If activating the purchase order will cause one of your funds to exceed its warning percentage, you will see a warning in the purchase order _Status_. If activating the purchase order will cause one of your funds to exceed its stop percentage, you will not be permitted to activate the purchase order.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_not_activatable.png[Purchase Order Can't be Activated]

Note that you can opt to allow a purchase order to be activated without items attached. If you wish to do this, select the checkbox _Allow Activation with Zero-Item Line Items?_

Once your purchase order is in an activatable state, you will see two options to activate the purchase order: _Activate Without Loading Items_, and _Activate Order_.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_activate_order.png[Activate Purchase Order]

If you select *Activate Without Loading Items*, the order will be activated but no on-order items will be loaded into your catalog. Once the purchase order has been activated without loading items, it is not possible to load the items. This feature should only be used in situations where the items have already been added to the catalog, such as:

* Cleaning up pre-acquisitions backlog
* Direct purchases that have already been cataloged

If you select *Activate Order*, the purchase order will be activated. Several things will happen when the order is activated:

* Bibliographic records and items will be loaded into the catalog
** If you did not already set call numbers and barcodes for items, Evergreen will generate placeholder call numbers and barcodes.
** Use the Library Settings _Acquisitions: Temporary barcode prefix_ and _Acquisitions: Temporary call number prefix_ to set prefixes for these placeholder values.
* Funds associated with the purchases will be encumbered
* If you are using EDI ordering, the Activate Order action will send the purchase order to the Provider indicated on the order.

After you click Activate Order, you will be presented with the record import interface if your purchase order contains items or records that are not already in the catalog. This interface will let you load on-order items and/or records into your catalog, and link these with the purchase order.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_load_records_and_activate.png[Load Records and Activate Purchase Order]

Loading parameters include templates, matching options, and quality parameters in the same manner that the regular xref:cataloging:batch_importing_MARC.adoc[MARC Batch Import/Export] tool uses.

*NOTE:* This interface will create records and items based on the information already included with the line items. For example, if your line items only contain brief record information, this is what will be loaded into the catalog.

Once you complete entering in the parameters for the record import interface, select *Submit*. A progress bar will appear and the purchase order screen will refresh when the load is complete.

[[receiving_line_items]]
=== Receiving Line Items ===

Marking line items as received indicates that your library has received the physical items ordered. To receive line items, open the purchase order in question. You can select individual line items, all line items in the page, or all line items on the purchase order. Navigate to the _Actions_ button in the upper left of your purchase order and select *Mark Selected Line Items as Received*.

The screen will refresh and the selected line items will now be in a Received status. If you have alerts on any line items, you will be presented with a confirmation dialog for each alert in your selected line items. If there are multiple alerts, the dialog will show “Alert X of Y” and you must acknowledge each alert to receive the line item(s) associated with the alert(s).

If you have erroneously received line items, you can select the line items in question and then navigate to the _Actions_ button in the upper left of your purchase order and select *Un-Receive Selected Line Items*. This will return selected items to an On Order status.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_receive_unreceive.png[Un-Receive Selected Line Items]

[[canceling_or_delaying_line_items]]
=== Canceling or Delaying Line Items ===

Line items may also be marked as Canceled or Delayed. Cancel and delay reasons and parameters are set up in xref:admin:acquisitions_admin.adoc#_canceldelay_reasons[Acquisitions Administration].

To cancel line items or mark them delayed, select one, several, or all line items in the purchase order:

. Navigate to the _Actions_ button in the upper left of your purchase order and select *Cancel Selected Line Items*.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_cancel_items.png[Action: Cancel Selected Line Items]
+
. You will see a dialog asking you to confirm the line item cancellation and select a cancel or delay reason.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_cancel_items_modal.png[Cancel Line Items Confirmation Modal]
+
. Choose your cancel or delay reason from the dropdown, and select *Apply* to cancel or delay the line item with the selected reason. Select *Exit Dialog* to exit without canceling items.

Cancel/delay reasons will appear on the worksheet and the printable purchase order.

Items which are marked canceled or delayed with a reason that has _Keep Debits_ set to true will still have their funds encumbered, and can still be marked received at the line item level.

Items which are marked canceled or delayed with a reason that has _Keep Debits_ set to false will have funds released and cannot be marked received at the line item level, and will further attempt to delete any catalog items associated with the canceled line item. Since deleting items requires the DELETE_COPY permission, the cancel or delay will fail with the ACQ_NOT_CANCELABLE error if the user does not have this permission.

*NOTE:* Using the *Actions -> Mark Selected Line Items as Received*
action will always receive canceled line items, regardless of the cancel reason. If the cancel reason had _Keep Debits_ set to false, the act of receiving said line item will recreate the encumbrance.

*NOTE:* When all the items of a line item are canceled through the
Acquisitions interface, the parent line item is also canceled. The
cancel reason will be calculated based on the following:

* The cancel reason for the last item to be canceled if the cancel reason’s _Keep Debits_ setting is true.
* The cancel reason for any other item on the line item if the cancel reason’s _Keep Debits_ setting is true.
* The cancel reason for the last item to be canceled if no items on the line item have a cancel reason where the _Keep Debits_ setting is true.

[[claiming_line_items]]
=== Claiming Line Items ===

Claiming lets you apply a claim policy to selected line items. Claiming policies are set up in xref:admin:acquisitions_admin.adoc#acq_claiming[Acquisitions Administration].

[NOTE]
You will not have the option to mark selected line items claimed until sufficient time has passed according to your claim policy. Applying a claim policy does not initiate a claim, it simply tells the system what to do when or if a claim is initiated.

The default claim policy associated with each Provider is automatically assigned to line items and items ordered from the provider, or you can choose to assign another claim policy to a line item.

. Select one, several, or all line items in the purchase order.
. Navigate to the _Actions_ button in the upper left of your purchase order and select *Apply Claim Policy to Selected Line Items*.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_apply_claim_policy.png[Action: Apply Claim Policy to Selected Line Items]
+
. You will see a dialog asking you to choose the claim policy to apply. Choose your claim policy from the dropdown, and select *Apply* to apply the claim policy. Select *Exit Dialog* to exit without applying a claim policy.
+
image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_apply_claim_policy_modal.png[Claim Policy Modal]

After you order an item, once the time interval defined by the claim policy has passed, you can claim the item. You can claim items individually by navigating to the _Line Item Actions Menu_ and selecting *Claims*.

image::selection_lists_po/acq_po_claim_item.png[Line Item Action: Claims]

A dialog will open allowing you to initiate a new claim against the line item. Select the item barcode(s) you wish to claim, select the _Claim Type_, and enter a _Claim Note_ if you wish.
