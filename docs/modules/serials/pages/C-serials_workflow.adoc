:toc:

The Serials Module can be used to create subscriptions, distributions, streams, and prediction patterns.  As well as to generate predictions and receive issues as they come in to the library.


To access the Serials Module, go to a serials record in the catalog, and click on *Serials->Manage Subscriptions*.  This will open the serials interface for that particular record.  In this interface you can:

. Create and manage subscriptions
. Create and manage predictions
. Create and manage issues
. Create and manage MFHDs

== Create a Subscription ==

. From a bibliographic record, go to *Serials->Manage Subscriptions*, view the _Manage Subscriptions_ tab. 
. Within the _Manage Subscriptions_ tab, create a new subscription by clicking *New Subscription*.  The subscription editor will appear:
.. Select the _Owning Library for_ the subscription.  The owning library indicates the organizational unit(s) whose staff can use this subscription. The rule of parental inheritance applies to this list. For example, if a system is made the owner of a subscription, then users, with appropriate permissions, at the branches within the system could also use this subscription.  This field is required.
.. Enter the date that the subscription begins in the _Start Dat_e field. This field is required.
.. An _End Date_ for the subscription may also be entered, but it is not required.
.. Optionally, enter an _Expected Offset_.  This is the difference between the nominal publishing date of an issue and the date that you expect to receive your copy. For example, if an issue is published the first day of each month, but you receive the copy two days prior to the publication date, then enter "-2 days" into this field.
.. Next, create a Distribution for the subscription by selecting the Library for the distribution.  Distributions identify the branches that will receive copies of a serial.
... Note: If the Owning Library of the subscription was set at the branch level, the Library will be the same as the Owning Library.  If the Owning Library of the subscription was set at the system level, the Library will be set to the holdings library.
.. Enter a Label for the distribution. It may be useful to identify the branch to which you are distributing these issues in this field. This field is not publicly visible and only appears when an item is received. There are no limits on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
.. Select the preferred _OPAC Display for holdings_: Chronological or Enumeration.
.. Select the _Receiving Template_ that will be applied to items as they are received.  The receiving templates are configured in Administration->Serials Administration->Serial Copy Templates.
.. Next, create a Stream by assigning a label to the stream in the _Send to_ field. The stream indicates the number of copies that should be sent to the distribution library.   You can click *Add copy stream* if the library will receive multiple copies of the serial.
. After the subscription, distribution, and copy information is configured, click *Save* and go to the _Manage Predictions_ tab to create the prediction pattern that will be used to generate predictions for this title.

NOTE: After creating a subscription, you can use the Actions menu to take a variety of actions with the subscription, such as adding Subscription or Distribution Notes, linking it to an MFHD record, or creating routing lists.

== Create and Manage Predictions ==

From the _Manage Predictions_ tab you can create a new prediction pattern from scratch, use an existing pattern template, or use an existing pattern template as the basis for a new prediction pattern.

=== Predict Issues Using a New Prediction Pattern ===
. Within the _Manage Predictions_ tab, _Select [a] subscription_ to work on from the drop down menu.
. To create a new prediction pattern, click *Add New*.
.. The box next to *Active* will be checked by default.
.. Select the _Type of pattern_ from the drop down menu and click *Create Pattern*.  The Pattern Wizard will appear.
.. Follow the steps in the section _Creating a Pattern Template_ in this documentation to create a new pattern using the wizard.

. After creating the pattern in the wizard, click *Create*.  The new prediction pattern will now appear under Existing Prediction Patterns.
. To create predictions, click *Predict New Issues*.

NOTE: You can also predict new issues from the _Manage Issues_ tab.

. A dialog box called _Predict New Issues: Initial Values_ will appear.
.. Select the _Publication date_ for the subscription.  This will be publication date of the first issue you expect to receive.
.. The _Type_ will correspond to the type of prediction pattern selected.
