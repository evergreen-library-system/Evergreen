== Adding Extra Copies ==
If the library receives an extra copy of an expected issue, the extra copy can be added to the list of predicted issues so it can be received through the serials module.

*To add an extra copy of an expected issue*:

. In the _Manage Issues_ tab, select the issuance that precedes the issuance that you received an extra copy of and go to *Actions->Add following issue* or _right-click_ on the issuance and select *Add following issue* from the menu.
. A dialog box will appear.  Verify that the _Publication date_, _Type_, and _Chronology_ labels are correct.  The _Enumeration_ labels will be filled in automatically when the issue is created.
. Click *Save* to create the extra copy of the following issue.
. The extra copy will appear in the list of issues and can be received using your typical workflow.
