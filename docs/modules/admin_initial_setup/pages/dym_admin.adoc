indexterm:[Searching,Search Suggestions] 

== Introduction

As of 3.7, the work for Did You Mean enables search suggestions for a search comprising a single word within a single search class. For the purposes of suggestions, a search class in Evergreen is a keyword, title, author, series, or subject. 

As of 3.11, search suggestions are offered for phrases and multi-word search within a single search class. Search suggestions can also leverage variant headings (4xx fields) in Authority records in this latest version, as long as search terms in these fields are in the symspell dictionary for the specified search class. Quoted phrases in search inputs require strict term order and adjacency for the phrase portion of the suggestion generated for the phrase(s), while unquoted search inputs do not require strict order and adjacency. 

Search suggestions are available in the public catalog (both TPAC and Bootstrap versions), the Children's OPAC (KPAC), and the Angular Staff Catalog.

Future iterations of this project are planning to add cross class and other search suggestion mechanisms.

Several search suggestion ordering mechanisms have been added, and are
described below in the Library Settings section. The relative weights of
each suggestion ordering mechanism can be adjusted to prioritize
different suggestion routes. Each Evergreen organization will need to
determine the best configuration of weights and suggestion ordering
settings.

Search suggestions are based on existing bibliographic data, and are
offered for potentially correctable spelling mistakes. A new set of
tables have been added to collect bibliographic data and build an
internal dictionary of potential search suggestions. When a catalog
search meets criteria for offering suggestions, this dictionary is used
to generate the suggestions.

The end user will be shown a configurable number of suggestions,
hyperlinked to execute a new search based on that suggestion. Any search
options such as Format that were initially set will be carried over to
the new search.

Evergreen’s existing use of search term stemming has not been altered as
a consequence of this work.

The Library Settings that were previously used to control the global behavior of search suggestions have been moved to search class configuration fields.  This was done because the data in each search class benefits from different setting values. These settings are documented below.

As in the previous iteration of Did You Mean, search suggestions are globally using Damerau-Levenshtein distance as their highest-weighted setting. Damerau-Levenshtein includes insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition. This is not a setting that can be changed, but the current implementation supports natural language word matching for Western languages.


== Search Results Display

In all cases, search suggestions will be offered for potentially
correctable spelling mistakes if a search retrieves fewer than a
configured number of results; and potential suggested terms appear at
least a configurable number of times within the bibliographic data. Both
of these thresholds are configured via Library Settings described below.

For examples of where suggestions display in various public catalog interfaces, please see the documentation in the  xref:opac:using_the_public_access_catalog.adoc#did_you_mean[Did You Mean?] section of the OPAC documentation. 

Search suggestions in the Staff Catalog appear at the bottom of the search area. Below is an example of a single word suggestion:

Authority record-based suggestions and phrase suggestions are also available in the public catalog.

== Administration

=== Did You Mean Configuration

To configure Did You Mean search settings, navigate to *Administration -> Server Administration -> MARC Search / Facet Classes*.

The screenshot below shows the new fields on MARC Search / Facet Classes to configure search suggestions. Please note that in the interest of visual spacing, the screenshot is deliberately not showing several extant MARC Search / Facet Class columns. These columns are still present and visible by default in this view.

The new configuration fields are described in the table below.

[width="100%",cols="25%,59%,16%",options="header",stripes=none]
|===
|*Field Name* |*Description* |*Default value*
|Low result threshold for suggestions |If a search results in this
number or fewer results, and there are correctable spelling mistakes, a
suggested search may be provided. If you want all searches to generate
suggestions, you can set this to an artificially high number, but it’s
possible that this will generate less-useful suggestions. |0 (only
searches with no hits)
|Max suggestions |If this is set to -1, the system will provide the best
suggestion (dependent on the weights of various suggestion mechanisms)
if and only if the term is considered misspelled based on the Minimum
required uses setting; if this is set to 1 or more, that is the maximum
number of suggestions that will be provided; if this is set to 0, no
suggestions will be provided. All values other than 0 only provide
suggestions that meet the Minimum required uses threshold, and only when
the Maximum search result count threshold is not passed. The maximum
recommended setting for this is 3, since suggestions become rapidly less
useful beyond that point. |-1
|Perform variant heading authority suggestion cross-reference |When set
to “Yes”, search suggestions will be offered from authority record 4xx
(See From Tracing) fields. Suggestions are only offered for fields in
the same search class, e.g., subject heading suggestions for subject
search. |Yes
|Minimum bib record suggestion threshold |The number of indexed
bibliographic strings in which a spelling suggestion must appear in
order to be offered to a user. Suggestions must appear in the bib data.
|1
|Suggestion SOUNDEX weight |Controls the relative weight of the scaled
soundex component. Setting this to 1 can improve suggestions for
catalogs that are primarily English. |0 (off)
|Suggestion PG Trigram weight |Controls the relative weight of the
scaled pg_trgm component. Setting this to 1 can significantly improve
suggestions for most catalogs. |0 (off)
|Suggestion keyboard distance weight |Controls the relative weight of
the scaled keyboard distance component. This option can have a negative
impact on suggestions and a value greater than 0 is not recommended for
most catalogs. |0 (off)
|Retain case in suggestions |Present search suggestions in the same
casing as the original user-input search terms. |Yes
|Avoid alternate suggestions on correctly spelled words |If set to Yes,
correctly spelled words will not have suggestions offered even if a
potential suggestion may exist in the bibliographic or authority data.
|No
|Symspell suggestion calculation verbosity |A setting used to control
the internal behavior of the SymSpell algorithm. It allows tuning the
balance between performance and suggestion generation, and is set to
provide the widest range of suggestion generation by default. |2
|Maximum average word edit distance |Suggestions that have an average
per-word edit distance larger than this are discarded. |2
|Maximum suggestions per word |The maximum number of suggestions offered
for each individual word in the search phrase. |5
|===

The three similarity measures, Pg_trgm (Tri-gram), Soundex, and keyboard distance weight, are calculated by comparing the user's search input
to each potential suggestion. The configured numerical values for
Pg_trgm, Soundex, and keyboard distance are multipliers for each similarity
measure. For example, setting the Pg_trgm weight to 2 will double the
raw score for that similarity measure.

The final order of a group of potential suggestions is determined first
by the Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, and then by the summed value
of the weighting measures, each multiplied by its score weight. If
suggestions coming from a particular corpus are shown to benefit from
giving additional consideration to one or more of the measures, their
weighting score can be increased.

Empirical testing and existing research shows that increasing the weight
of any similarity measure beyond 1 is not useful in a reasonable,
representative set of bibliographic records, and that a multiplier of 1
for Pg_trgm and Soundex is ideal for primarily-English catalogs, but all
data sets vary.

=== Internal flags

The suggestion mechanism primarily uses a SymSpell implementation in
Evergreen’s Postgres database. The SymSpell edit distance and prefix key
length are controlled by two internal global flags,
*symspell.prefix_length* and *symspell.max_edit_distance*. A full
dictionary rebuild is required if either of these flags are changed.

The SymSpell algorithm mandates the use of the Damerau-Levenshtein
algorithm which includes insertion, deletion, substitution, and
transposition cost calculations. While the original plan was to make use
of the built-in Postgres implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance
algorithm, results of partner testing led us to replace the built-in
option with an external Damerau-Levenshtein implementation.

A recommended set of values for the SymSpell settings is *6* for
*symspell.prefix_length* and *3* for *symspell.max_edit_distance*.

This set of values is known to provide a very good balance between
accuracy and resource consumption based on empirical testing of the
algorithm and analysis of English language texts. For further
explanation of why these settings are recommended, please see
