= Did You Mean?: Search Suggestions Administration

indexterm:[Searching,Search Suggestions] 

== Introduction

As of 3.7, the work for Did You Mean enables search suggestions for a search comprising a single word within a single search class. For the purposes of suggestions, a search class in Evergreen is a keyword, title, author, series, or subject. Search suggestions are available in the public catalog (both TPAC and Bootstrap versions), the Children's OPAC (KPAC), and the Angular Staff Catalog.

Future iterations of this project are planning to add multi word, cross
class, and other search suggestion mechanisms.

Several search suggestion ordering mechanisms have been added, and are
described below in the Library Settings section. The relative weights of
each suggestion ordering mechanism can be adjusted to prioritize
different suggestion routes. Each Evergreen organization will need to
determine the best configuration of weights and suggestion ordering
settings.

Search suggestions are based on existing bibliographic data, and are
offered for potentially correctable spelling mistakes. A new set of
tables have been added to collect bibliographic data and build an
internal dictionary of potential search suggestions. When a catalog
search meets criteria for offering suggestions, this dictionary is used
to generate the suggestions.

The end user will be shown a configurable number of suggestions,
hyperlinked to execute a new search based on that suggestion. Any search
options such as Format that were initially set will be carried over to
the new search.

Evergreen’s existing use of search term stemming has not been altered as
a consequence of this work.

== Search Results Display

In all cases, search suggestions will be offered for potentially
correctable spelling mistakes if a search retrieves fewer than a
configured number of results; and potential suggested terms appear at
least a configurable number of times within the bibliographic data. Both
of these thresholds are configured via Library Settings described below.

For examples of where suggestions display in various public catalog interfaces, please see the documentation in the  xref:opac:using_the_public_access_catalog.adoc#did_you_mean[Did You Mean?] section of the OPAC documentation. 

Search suggestions in the Staff Catalog appear at the bottom of the search area.

== Administration

=== Library Settings

Search suggestions are controlled by several Library Settings. Three
settings set thresholds for spelling suggestions, and three settings
control the weighting of different suggestion mechanisms. A lower number
represents a ‘lighter’ weight. All settings accept a number value as
input. Library settings are inheritable, unless there is an
organizationally closer setting.

* *Maximum search result count at which spelling suggestions may be offered*
** Default value is 0, which means suggestions will only be offered if
there are no results.
** If a search has this number or fewer results, and there are correctable
spelling mistakes, a suggested search may be provided.
** If you want all searches to generate suggestions, you can set this to an
artificially high number, but it’s possible that this will generate
less-useful suggestions.
* *Minimum required uses of a spelling suggestions that may be offered*
** Default is 1.
** The number of indexed bibliographic strings in which a spelling
suggestion must appear in order to be offered to a user. Suggestions
must appear in the bib data.
* *Maximum number of spelling suggestions that may be offered*
** The maximum recommended value for this setting is 3, since suggestions
become rapidly less useful beyond that point.
** If this is set to 0, no suggestions will be provided.
** All values other than 0 only provide suggestions that meet the *Minimum
required uses* threshold, and only when the *Maximum search result
count* threshold is not passed.
** If this is set to -1, the system will provide the best suggestion
(dependent on the weights of various suggestion mechanisms) if and only
if the term is considered misspelled based on the *Minimum required
uses* setting.
** If this is set to 1 or more, that is the maximum number of suggestions
that will be provided.
* *Pg_trgm score weighting in OPAC spelling suggestions*
** Defaults to 0 for "off".
** Controls the relative weight of the scaled pg_trgm component.
** Input can be any positive or negative whole number, but testing
demonstrates that setting this to 1 can significantly improve
suggestions for most catalogs.
* *Soundex score weighting in OPAC spelling suggestions*
** Defaults to 0 for "off".
** Controls the relative weight of the scaled soundex component.
** Input can be any positive or negative whole number, but testing
demonstrates that setting this to 1 can improve suggestions for catalogs
that are primarily English.
* *Keyboard distance score weighting in OPAC spelling suggestions*
** Defaults to 0 for "off".
** Controls the relative weight of the scaled keyboard distance component.
** While this option is available, it can have a negative impact on
suggestions and a value greater than 0 is not recommended for most
catalogs.
** If an administrator decides to use this weighting, it will accept any
positive or negative whole number value.


The three similarity measures, Pg_trgm (Tri-gram), Soundex, and QWERTY
Keyboard similarity, are calculated by comparing the user's search input
to each potential suggestion. The Library Setting numerical values for
Pg_trgm, Soundex, and QWERTY are multipliers for each similarity
measure. For example, setting the Pg_trgm weight to 2 will double the
raw score for that similarity measure.

The final order of a group of potential suggestions is determined first
by the Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, and then by the summed value
of the weighting measures, each multiplied by its score weight. If
suggestions coming from a particular corpus are shown to benefit from
giving additional consideration to one or more of the measures, their
weighting score can be increased.

Empirical testing and existing research shows that increasing the weight
of any similarity measure beyond 1 is not useful in a reasonable,
representative set of bibliographic records, and that a multiplier of 1
for Pg_trgm and Soundex is ideal for primarily-English catalogs, but all
data sets vary.

=== Internal flags

The suggestion mechanism primarily uses a SymSpell implementation in
Evergreen’s Postgres database. The SymSpell edit distance and prefix key
length are controlled by two internal global flags,
*symspell.prefix_length* and *symspell.max_edit_distance*. A full
dictionary rebuild is required if either of these flags are changed.

The SymSpell algorithm mandates the use of the Damerau-Levenshtein
algorithm which includes insertion, deletion, substitution, and
transposition cost calculations. While the original plan was to make use
of the built-in Postgres implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance
algorithm, results of partner testing led us to replace the built-in
option with an external Damerau-Levenshtein implementation.

A recommended set of values for the SymSpell settings is *6* for
*symspell.prefix_length* and *3* for *symspell.max_edit_distance*.

This set of values is known to provide a very good balance between
accuracy and resource consumption based on empirical testing of the
algorithm and analysis of English language texts. For further
explanation of why these settings are recommended, please see
