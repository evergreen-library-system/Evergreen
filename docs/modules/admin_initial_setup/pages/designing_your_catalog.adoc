= Designing your catalog =
:toc:

When people want to find things in your Evergreen system, they will check the
catalog. In Evergreen, the catalog is made available through a web interface,
called the _OPAC_ (Online Public Access Catalog). In the latest versions of the
Evergreen system, the OPAC is built on a set of programming modules called the
Template Toolkit. You will see the OPAC sometimes referred to as the _TPAC_.

In this chapter, we'll show you how to customize the OPAC, change it from its
default configuration, and make it your own.

== Configuring and customizing the public interface ==

The public interface is referred to as the TPAC or Template Toolkit (TT) within
the Evergreen community. The template toolkit system allows you to customize the
look and feel of your OPAC by editing the template pages (.tt2) files as well as
the associated style sheets.   

=== Locating the default template files ===

The default URL for the TPAC on a default Evergreen system is
_http://localhost/eg/opac/home_ (adjust _localhost_ to match your hostname or IP
address).

The default template file is installed in _/openils/var/templates/opac_.

You should generally avoid touching the installed default template files, unless
you are contributing changes for Evergreen to adopt as a new default. Even then,
while you are developing your changes, consider using template overrides rather
than touching the installed templates until you are ready to commit the changes
to a branch. See below for information on template overrides.

=== Mapping templates to URLs ===

The mapping for templates to URLs is straightforward. Following are a few
examples, where _<templates>_ is a placeholder for one or more directories that
will be searched for a match:

* _http://localhost/eg/opac/home => /openils/var/<templates>/opac/home.tt2_
* _http://localhost/eg/opac/advanced =>
/openils/var/<templates>/opac/advanced.tt2_
* _http://localhost/eg/opac/results => 
/openils/var/<templates>/opac/results.tt2_

The template files themselves can process, be wrapped by, or include other
template files. For example, the _home.tt2_ template currently involves a number
of other template files to generate a single HTML file.

Example Template Toolkit file: _opac/home.tt2_.
----
[%  PROCESS "opac/parts/header.tt2";
    WRAPPER "opac/parts/base.tt2";
    INCLUDE "opac/parts/topnav.tt2";
    ctx.page_title = l("Home") %]
    <div id="search-wrapper">
      [% INCLUDE "opac/parts/searchbar.tt2" %]
    </div>
    <div id="content-wrapper">
        <div id="main-content-home">
             <div class="common-full-pad"></div>
             [% INCLUDE "opac/parts/homesearch.tt2" %]
             <div class="common-full-pad"></div>
        </div>
     </div>
[% END %]
----
Note that file references are relative to the top of the template directory.

=== How to override template files ===

Overrides for template files or TPAC pages go in a directory that parallels the
structure of the default templates directory. The overrides then get pulled in
via the Apache configuration.

The following example demonstrates how to create a file that overrides the
default "Advanced search page" (_advanced.tt2_) by adding a new 
_templates_custom_ directory and editing the new file in that directory.

----
bash$ mkdir -p /openils/var/templates_custom/opac
bash$ cp /openils/var/templates/opac/advanced.tt2 \
         /openils/var/templates_custom/opac/.
bash$ vim /openils/var/templates_custom/opac/advanced.tt2
----

=== Configuring the custom templates directory in Apache's eg.conf ===

You now need to teach Apache about the new custom template directory. Edit
_/etc/apache2/sites-available/eg.conf_ and add the following _<Location /eg>_
element to each of the _<VirtualHost>_ elements in which you want to include the
overrides. The default Evergreen configuration includes a VirtualHost directive
for port 80 (HTTP) and another one for port 443 (HTTPS); you probably want to
edit both, unless you want the HTTP user experience to be different from the
HTTPS user experience.

----
<VirtualHost *:80>
    # <snip>

    # - absorb the shared virtual host settings
    Include eg_vhost.conf
    <Location /eg>
        PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates_custom"
    </Location>

    # <snip>
</VirtualHost>
----

Finally, reload the Apache configuration to pick up the changes. You should now
be able to see your change at _http://localhost/eg/opac/advanced_ where
_localhost_ is the hostname of your Evergreen server.

=== Adjusting colors for your public interface ===

You may adjust the colors of your public interface by editing the _colors.tt2_
file. The location of this file is in 
_/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/css/colors.tt2_. When you customize the
colors of your public interface, remember to create a custom file in your custom
template folder and edit the custom file and not the file located in your default
template.    

=== Adjusting fonts in your public interface ===

Font sizes can be changed in the _colors.tt2_ file located in
_/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/css/_. Again, create and edit a custom
template version and not the file in the default template.

Other aspects of fonts such as the default font family can be adjusted in
_/openils/var/templates/opac/css/style.css.tt2_. 

=== Media file locations in the public interface ===
The media files (mostly PNG images) used by the default TPAC templates are stored
in the repository in _Open-ILS/web/images/_ and installed in
_/openils/var/web/images/_.

=== Changing some text in the public interface ===

Out of the box, TPAC includes a number of placeholder text and links. For
example, there is a set of links cleverly named Link 1, Link 2, and so on in the
header and footer of every page in TPAC. Here is how to customize that for a 
_custom templates_ skin.

To begin with, find the page(s) that contain the text in question. The simplest
way to do that is with the grep -s command. In the following example, search for
files that contain the text "Link 1":

----
bash$ grep -r "Link 1" /openils/var/templates/opac
/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2
4:            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 1') %]</a>
----


Next, copy the file into our overrides directory and edit it with vim.

Copying the links file into the overrides directory.

----
bash$ cp /openils/var/templates/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2 \
/openils/var/templates_custom/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2
bash$ vim /openils/var/templates_custom/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2
----

Finally, edit the link text in _opac/parts/header.tt2_. Content of the
_opac/parts/header.tt2_ file.

----
<div id="gold-links-holder">
    <div id="gold-links">
        <div id="header-links">
            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 1') %]</a>
            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 2') %]</a>
            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 3') %]</a>
            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 4') %]</a>
            <a href="http://example.com">[% l('Link 5') %]</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
----

For the most part, the page looks like regular HTML, but note the `[%_(" ")%]`
that surrounds the text of each link. The `[% ... %]` signifies a TT block,
which can contain one or more TT processing instructions. `l(" ... ");` is a
function that marks text for localization (translation); a separate process can
subsequently extract localized text as GNU gettext-formatted PO (Portable
Object) files.

As Evergreen supports multiple languages, any customization to Evergreen's
default text must use the localization function. Also, note that the
localization function supports placeholders such as `[_1]`, `[_2]` in the text;
these are replaced by the contents of variables passed as extra arguments to the
`l()` function.

Once the link and link text has been edited to your satisfaction, load the page
in a Web browser and see the live changes immediately.

=== Adding translations to PO file ===

After you have added custom text in translatable form to a TT2 template, you need to add the custom strings and its translations to the PO file containing the translations. Evergreen PO files are stored  in _/openils/var/template/data/locale/_ 

The PO file consists of pairs of the text extracted from the code:  Message ID  denoted as _msgid_ and message string denoted as _msgstr_.  When adding the custom string to PO file: 

* The line with English expressions must start with _msgid_. The English term must be enclosed in double apostrophes. 
* The line with translation start with /msgstr/. The translation to local language must be and enclosed in enclosed in double apostrophes.  
* It is recommended to  add a note in which template and on which line the particular string is located. The lines with notes must be marked as comments i.e., start with number sign (#) 

Example: 

----

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The lines below contains the custom strings manually added to the catalog
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

#: ../../Open-ILS/src/custom_templates/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2:1
msgid "Union Catalog of the Czech Republic"
msgstr "Souborný katalog České republiky"


#: ../../Open-ILS/src/custom_templates/opac/parts/topnav_links.tt2:1
msgid "Uniform Information Gateway "
msgstr "Jednotná informační brána"

----

[NOTE]
====
It is good practice to save backup copy of the original PO file before changing it.
====

After making changes, restart Apache to make the changes take effect. As root run the command:

----
service apache2 restart
----

=== Adding and removing MARC fields from the record details display page ===

It is possible to add and remove the MARC fields and subfields displayed in the
record details page.  In order to add MARC fields to be displayed on the details
page of a record, you will need to map the MARC code to variables in the
_/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/misc_util.tt2 file_.

For example, to map the template variable _args.pubdates_ to the date of
publication MARC field 260, subfield c, add these lines to _misc_util.tt2_:

----
args.pubdates = [];
FOR sub IN xml.findnodes('//*[@tag="260"]/*[@code="c"]');
    args.pubdates.push(sub.textContent);
END;
args.pubdate = (args.pubdates.size) ? args.pubdates.0 : ''
----

You will then need to edit the 
_/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/record/summary.tt2_ file in  order to get the
template variable for the MARC field to display.

For example, to display the date of publication code you created in the
_misc_util.tt2_ file, add these lines:

----
[% IF attrs.pubdate; %]
    <span itemprop="datePublished">[% attrs.pubdate | html; %]</span>
[% END; %]
----

You can add any MARC field to your record details page. Moreover, this approach
can also be used to display MARC fields in other pages, such as your results
page.

==== Using bibliographic source variables ====

For bibliographic records, there is a "bib source" that can be associated with
every record. This source and its ID are available as record attributes called
_bib_source.source_ and _bib_source.id_.  These variables do not present
themselves in the catalog display by default.

.Example use case
****

In this example, a library imports e-resource records from a third party and
uses the bib source to indicate where the records came from. Patrons can place
holds on these titles, but they must be placed via the vendor website, not in
Evergreen. By exposing the bib source, the library can alter the Place Hold
link for these records to point at the vendor website.

****

== Setting the default physical location for your library environment ==

_physical_loc_ is an Apache environment variable that sets the default physical
location, used for setting search scopes and determining the order in which
copies should be sorted. This variable is set in
_/etc/apache2/sites-available/eg.conf_. The following example demonstrates the
default physical location being set to library ID 104:

----
SetEnv physical_loc 104
----

[#setting_a_default_language_and_adding_optional_languages]
== Setting a default language and adding optional languages ==

_OILSWebLocale_ adds support for a specific language. Add this variable to the
Virtual Host section in _/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf_.

_OILSWebDefaultLocale_ specifies which locale to display when a user lands on a
page in TPAC and has not chosen a different locale from the TPAC locale picker.
The following example shows the _fr_ca_ locale being added to the locale picker
and being set as the default locale:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebLocale "fr_ca"
PerlAddVar OILSWebLocale "/openils/var/data/locale/opac/fr-CA.po"
PerlAddVar OILSWebDefaultLocale "fr-CA"
----

Below is a table of the currently supported languages packaged with Evergreen:

[options="header"]
|===
|Language| Code| PO file
|Arabic - Jordan| ar_jo | /openils/var/data/locale/opac/ar-JO.po
|Armenian| hy_am| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/hy-AM.po
|Czech| cs_cz| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/cs-CZ.po
|English - Canada| en_ca| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/en-CA.po
|English - Great Britain| en_gb| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/en-GB.po
|*English - United States| en_us| not applicable
|French - Canada| fr_ca| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/fr-CA.po
|Portuguese - Brazil| pt_br| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/pt-BR.po
|Spanish| es_es| /openils/var/data/locale/opac/es-ES.po
|===
*American English is built into Evergreen so you do not need to set up this
language and there are no PO files. 

=== Updating translations in Evergreen using current translations from Launchpad ===

Due to Evergreen release workflow/schedule, some language strings may already have been translated in Launchpad,
but are not yet packaged with Evergreen. In such cases, it is possible to manually replace the PO file in
Evergreen with an up-to-date PO file downloaded from Launchpad. 

. Visit the Evergreen translation site in https://translations.launchpad.net/evergreen[Launchpad] 
. Select required language (e.g. _Czech_ or _Spanish_)
. Open the  _tpac_  template  and  then select option _Download translation_. Note: to be able to download the translation file you need to be logged in to Launchpad.
. Select _PO format_ and submit the _request for download_ button. You can also request for download of all existing templates and languages at once, see https://translations.launchpad.net/evergreen/master/+export. The download link will be sent You to email address provided. 
. Download the file and name it according to the language used (e.g., _cs-CZ.po_ for Czech or  _es-ES.po_ for Spanish)  
. Copy the downloaded file to  _/openils/var/template/data/locale_. It is a good practice to backup the original PO file before.
. Be sure that the desired language is set as default, using the xref:#setting_a_default_language_and_adding_optional_languages[Default language] procedures.

Analogously, to update the web staff client translations, download the translation template _webstaff_ and copy it to _openils/var/template/data/locale/staff_.


Changes require web server reload to take effect. As root run the command 

----
service apache2 restart
----

== Change Date Format in Patron Account View ==
Libraries with same-day circulations may want their patrons to be able to view
the due *time* as well as due date when they log in to their OPAC account.  To
accomplish this, go to _opac/myopac/circs.tt2_.  Find the line that reads:

----
[% date.format(due_date, DATE_FORMAT) %]
----

Replace it with:

----
[% date.format(due_date, '%D %I:%M %p') %]
----


== Including External Content in Your Public Interface ==

The public interface allows you to include external services and content in your
public interface. These can include book cover images, user reviews, table of
contents, summaries, author notes, annotations, user suggestions, series
information among other services. Some of these services are free while others
require a subscription.    

The following are some of the external content services which you can configure
in Evergreen.

=== OpenLibrary ===

The default install of Evergreen includes OpenLibrary book covers. The settings
for this are controlled by the <added_content> section of
_/openils/conf/opensrf.xml_. Here are the key elements of this configuration:

----
<module>OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::OpenLibrary</module>
----

This section calls the OpenLibrary perl module. If you wish to link to a
different book cover service other than OpenLibrary, you must refer to the
location of the corresponding Perl module. You will also need to change other
settings accordingly.

----
<timeout>1</timeout>
----

Max number of seconds to wait for an added content request to return data. Data 
not returned within the timeout is considered a failure.
----
<retry_timeout>600</retry_timeout>
----

This setting is the amount of time to wait before we try again.

----
<max_errors>15</max_errors>
----

Maximum number of consecutive lookup errors a given process can have before
added content lookups are disabled for everyone. To adjust the site of the cover
image on the record details page edit the config.tt2 file and change the value
of the record.summary.jacket_size. The default value is "medium" and the
available options are "small", "medium" and "large."   

=== ChiliFresh ===

ChiliFresh is a subscription-based service which allows book covers, reviews and
social interaction of patrons to appear in your catalog. To activate ChiliFresh,
you will need to open the Apache configuration file _/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf_
and edit several lines:

. Uncomment (remove the "#" at the beginning of the line) and add your ChiliFresh
account number:

----
#SetEnv OILS_CHILIFRESH_ACCOUNT
----

. Uncomment this line and add your ChiliFresh Profile:

----
#SetEnv OILS_CHILIFRESH_PROFILE
----

Uncomment the line indicating the location of the Evergreen JavaScript for
ChiliFresh:

----
#SetEnv OILS_CHILIFRESH_URL http://chilifresh.com/on-site /js/evergreen.js
----

. Uncomment the line indicating the secure URL for the Evergreen JavaScript :

----
#SetEnv OILS_CHILIFRESH_HTTPS_URL https://secure.chilifresh.com/on-site/js/evergreen.js
----

[id="_content_cafe"]
Content Café
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Content Café is a subscription-based service that can add  jacket images,
reviews, summaries, tables of contents and book details to your records.

In order to activate Content Café, edit the _/openils/conf/opensrf.xml_ file and
change the _<module>_ element to point to the ContentCafe Perl Module:

----
<module>OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::ContentCafe</module>
----

To adjust settings for Content Café, edit a couple of fields with the
_<ContentCafe>_ Section of _/openils/conf/opensrf.xml_.

Edit the _userid_ and _password_ elements to match the user id and password for
your Content Café account.

This provider retrieves content based on ISBN or UPC, with a default preference
for ISBNs.  If you wish for UPCs to be preferred, or wish one of the two identifier
types to not be considered at all, you can change the "identifier_order" option
in opensrf.xml.  When the option is present, only the identifier(s) listed will
be sent.

=== Obalkyknih.cz ===

==== Setting up Obalkyknih.cz account ====

If your library wishes to use added content provided by Obalkyknih.cz, a service based in the Czech Republic, you have to http://obalkyknih.cz/signup[create an Obalkyknih.cz account].
Please note that the interface is only available in Czech. After logging in your Obalkyknih.cz account, you have to add your IP address and Evergreen server address to your account settings.
(In case each library uses an address of its own, all of these addresses have to be added.) 

==== Enabling Obalkyknih.cz in Evergreen ====

Set obalkyknih_cz.enabled to true in '/openils/var/templates/opac/parts/config.tt2':

[source,perl]
----
obalkyknih_cz.enabled = 'true';
----

Enable added content from Obalkyknih.cz in '/openils/conf/opensrf.xml' configuration file (and – at the same time – disable added content from Open Library, i.e., Evergreen's default added content provider):

[source,xml]
----
<!-- <module>OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::OpenLibrary</module> -->
<module>OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::ObalkyKnih</module>
----

Using default settings for Obalkyknih.cz means all types of added content from Obalkyknih.cz are visible in your online catalog.
If the module is enabled, book covers are always displayed. Other types of added content (summaries, ratings or tables of contents) can be: 

* switched off using _false_ option,
* switched on again using _true_ option.

The following types of added content are used: 

* summary (or annotation)
* tocPDF (table of contents available as image)
* tocText (table of contents available as text)
* review (user reviews)

An example of how to switch off summaries: 

[source,xml]
----
<summary>false</summary>
----


=== Google Analytics ===

Google Analytics is a free service to collect statistics for your Evergreen
site. Statistic tracking is disabled by default through the Evergreen 
client software when library staff use your site within the client, but active 
when anyone uses the site without the client. This was a preventive measure to 
reduce the potential risks for leaking patron information. In order to use Google 
Analytics you will first need to set up the service from the Google Analytics 
website at http://www.google.com/analytics/. To activate Google Analytics you 
will need to edit _config.tt2_ in your template. To enable the service set 
the value of google_analytics.enabled to true and change the value of 
_google_analytics.code_ to be the code in your Google Analytics account.

=== Matomo Analytics ===

Matomo Analytics (https://matomo.org/) is free software that you can host
yourself, so that you can collect web site statistics without sharing your
users' data with third parties.  Statistic tracking is disabled by default
through the Evergreen client software when library staff use your site within
the client, but active when anyone uses the site without the client.  This was
a preventive measure to reduce the potential risks for leaking patron
information. To use Matomo Analytics you need to:

. Set up a hosted instance of Matomo
. Add your Evergreen catalog as a site
. Use the Library Settings Editor to add a Matomo URL and Site ID for your library.

Typically, Matomo will give you a block of javascript you can insert into
web sites. One line will look like:

var u="http://mylibrary.lib/matomo/";

The full URL in the double quotes will be your URL.  Another line
will look like:

_paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);

In this case the number 1 will be your site ID.


=== NoveList ===

Novelist is a subscription-based service providing reviews and recommendation
for books in you catalog. To activate your Novelist service in Evergreen, open
the Apache configuration file _/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf_ and edit the line:

----
#SetEnv OILS_NOVELIST_URL
----

You should use the URL provided by NoveList.

=== RefWorks ===

RefWorks is a subscription-based online bibliographic management tool. If you
have a RefWorks subscription, you can activate RefWorks in Evergreen by editing
the _config.tt2_ file located in your template directory. You will need to set
the _ctx.refworks.enabled_ value to _true_. You may also set the RefWorks URL by
changing the _ctx.refworks.url_ setting on the same file. 

=== SFX OpenURL Resolver ===

An OpenURL resolver allows you to find electronic resources and pull them into
your catalog based on the ISBN or ISSN of the item. In order to use the SFX
OpenURL resolver, you will need to subscribe to the Ex Libris SFX service.  To
activate the service in Evergreen edit the _config.tt2_ file in your template.
Enable the resolver by changing the value of _openurl.enabled_ to _true_ and
change the _openurl.baseurl_ setting to point to the URL of your OpenURL
resolver. 

=== Syndetic Solutions ===

Syndetic Solutions is a subscription service providing book covers and other
data for items in your catalog. In order to activate Syndetic, edit the
_/openils/conf/opensrf.xml_ file and change the _<module>_ element to point to
the Syndetic Perl Module:

----
<module>OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::Syndetic</module>
----

You will also need to edit the  _<userid>_ element to be the user id provided to
you by Syndetic.

Then, you will need to uncomment and edit the _<base_url>_ element so that it
points to the Syndetic service:

----
<base_url>http://syndetics.com/index.aspx</base_url>
----

For changes to be activated for your public interface you will need to restart
Evergreen and Apache.

The Syndetic Solutions provider retrieves images based on the following identifiers
found in bibliographic records:

* ISBN
* UPC
* ISSN


=== Clear External/Added Content Cache ===

On the catalog's record summary page, there is a link for staff that will forcibly clear 
the cache of the Added Content for that record. This is helpful for when the Added Content 
retrieved the wrong cover jacket art, summary, etc. and caches the wrong result.

image::media/clear-added-content-cache-1.png[Clear Cache Link]

Once clicked, there is a pop up that will display what was cleared from the cache. 

image::media/clear-added-content-cache-2.jpg[Example Popup]

You will need to reload the record in the staff client to obtain the new images from your 
Added Content Supplier.


=== Configure a Custom Image for Missing Images ===

You can configure a "no image" image other than the standard 1-pixel
blank image.  The example eg_vhost.conf file provides examples in the
comments.  Note: Evergreen does not provide default images for these.


== Including Locally Hosted Content in Your Public Interface ==

It is also possible to show added content that has been generated locally 
by placing the content in a specific spot on the web server.  It is 
possible to have local book jackets, reviews, TOC, excerpts or annotations.

=== File Location and Format ===

By default the files will need to be placed in directories under 
*/openils/var/web/opac/extras/ac/* on the server(s) that run Apache.

The files need to be in specific folders depending on the format of the 
added content.  Local Content can only be looked up based on the 
record ID at this time.

.URL Format:
\http://catalog/opac/extras/ac/*\{type}/\{format}/r/\{recordid}*

 * *type* is one of *jacket*, *reviews*, *toc*, *excerpt* or *anotes*.
  * *format* is type dependent:
    - for jacket, one of small, medium or large
    - others, one of html, xml or json ... html is the default for non-image added content
  * *recordid* is the bibliographic record id (bre.id).

=== Example ===

If you have some equipment that you are circulating such as a 
laptop or eBook reader and you want to add an image of the equipment 
that will show up in the catalog.

[NOTE]
=============
If you are adding jacket art for a traditional type of media 
(book, CD, DVD) consider adding the jacket art to the http://openlibrary.org 
project instead of hosting it locally.  This would allow other 
libraries to benefit from your work.
=============

Make note of the Record ID of the bib record.  You can find this by 
looking at the URL of the bib in the catalog.  
http://catalog/eg/opac/record/*123*, 123 is the record ID.  
These images will only show up for one specific record.

Create 3 different sized versions of the image in png or jpg format.

 * *Small* - 80px x 80px - named _123-s.jpg_ or _123-s.png_ - This is displayed in the browse display.
 * *Medium* - 240px x 240px - named _123-m.jpg_ or _123-m.png_ - This is displayed on the summary page.
 * *Large* - 400px x 399px - named _123-l.jpg_ or _123-l.png_ - This is displayed if the summary page image is clicked on.

[NOTE] 
The image dimensions are up to you, use what looks good in your catalog.
 
Next, upload the images to the evergreen server(s) that run apache, 
and move/rename the files to the following locations/name.  
You will need to create directories that are missing.
 
 * Small - Move the file *123-s.jpg* to */openils/var/web/opac/extras/ac/jacket/small/r/123*
 * Medium - Move the file *123-m.jpg* to */openils/var/web/opac/extras/ac/jacket/medium/r/123*.

== Styling the searchbar on the homepage ==

The `.searchbar-home` class is added to the div that
contains the searchbar when on the homepage.  This allows
sites to customize the searchbar differently on the
homepage than in search results pages, and other places the
search bar appears.  For example, adding the following CSS
would create a large, Google-style search bar on the homepage only:

[source,css]
----
.searchbar-home .search-box {
  width: 80%;
  height: 3em;
}

.searchbar-home #search_qtype_label,
.searchbar-home #search_itype_label,
.searchbar-home #search_locg_label {
  display:none;
}
