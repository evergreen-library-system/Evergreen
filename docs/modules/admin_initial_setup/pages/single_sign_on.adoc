= Single Sign On for Evergreen OPAC
:toc:

indexterm:[Authentication,Single Sign On,Identity Provider]

== Introduction

The Single Sign On mechanism for the Evergreen OPAC adds the ability for
Evergreen to authenticate users against a configurable authoritative
external source, using Shibboleth.

Single Sign On systems are often used in academic institutions as a way
to authenticate students, faculty, and staff across a wide range of
separate digital services. The goal of a Single Sign On system is to
permit a user to log in with a single set of credentials across all of
these services. Each service talks to an Identity Provider (IdP) which
confirms that a given user is authorized to use the service. For
example, a college might be able to use an IdP to support a single login
which will authenticate a student to the library catalog, the schoolâ€™s
collection of databases, and internal school services such as the
registrar.

This feature supports setting up separate Identity Providers within a
single Evergreen instance, and this is controlled via an Apache
VirtualHost configuration which is described in detail below.

This feature does not offer external authentication for the Evergreen
staff client.

== Public Catalog Display

If a location has Single Sign On activated, by default a patron will be
required to authenticate the Single Sign On service. In most cases the
patron will be transparently redirected to the Single Sign On login.
However, if a patron navigates directly to the URL
`+https://<your.evergreen.domain>/eg/opac/login+`, they will be presented
with a prompt redirecting them to the Single Sign On service:

If a location wishes to permit Evergreen-native authentication as well
as Single Sign On authentication, the Library Setting _Allow both
Shibboleth and native OPAC authentication_ should be set to TRUE. In
that case, a patron who navigates to the login page, or to a page
requiring authentication, will see this:

image:sso/sso_and_native.png[Single Sign on and native authentication permitted]

== Administration

Single Sign On is controlled by several Evergreen Library Settings, and
an Apache setting. There is one new permission.

=== Permissions

Users must have the new SSO_ADMIN permission assigned at the appropriate
working locations and depths in order to set or change any of the below
Library Settings.

=== Library Settings

Library settings are inheritable, unless there is an organizationally
closer setting.

* *Enable Shibboleth SSO for the OPAC*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Controls whether Shibboleth is being used.
* *Allow both Shibboleth and native OPAC authentication*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is false, which will redirect patrons to the configured Single
Sign On service.
** If set to true, patrons will still be presented with an Evergreen login
form when Single Sign On is enabled.
* *Log out of the Shibboleth IdP*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is false, which will leave a user logged into Shibboleth but
will forget their Evergreen authoken and set a cookie so they are logged
out of Evergreen until they choose to log back in.
** If set to true, the user will be logged out of Shibboleth when they log
out of Evergreen. Additionally, if the IdP implements the
SingleLogoutService option, the user will be logged out of the IdP as
well.
** This setting works on an intentional logout; a timeout behaves
differently (see below).
* *Shibboleth SSO Entity ID*
** Text
** Records which configured Entity ID to use for Single Sign On, if there
are multiple Identity Providers in use by a single Evergreen instance.
* *Evergreen SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which field carries the ID that Shibboleth is looking for.
Default is *usrname*, but also accepts *barcode* and *email* (note the
last is not a unique value in Evergreen).
* *Shibboleth SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which value is coming from Shibboleth that Evergreen will need
to look up a user. This is defined in the Shibboleth configuration and
defaults to *uid*.

Note that the existing Library Setting _OPAC Inactivity Timeout_ will
log a user out of Evergreen but not out of Shibboleth. Shibboleth has a
separate configured timeout value. If the user is logged out of
Evergreen due to a timeout, but is still logged in to Shibboleth, they
will be transparently reauthenticated to Evergreen when they select the
*MyAccount* button.

=== Apache Settings

In order to identify which location (i.e., Organizational Unit) is used
as the context location for Shibboleth-related library settings, the
*sso_loc* Apache variable can be set. This is configured per hostname in
exactly the same way as the *physical_loc* Apache variable. For example:

....
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ...
    SetEnv sso_loc 101
  # The following may be necessary based on how Shibboleth is configured
  <Location />
    ShibRequestSetting applicationId otheridp
  </Location>
  ...
</VirtualHost>
....

If *sso_loc* is not set, Evergreen will check for a *physical_loc*
setting, and finally, fall back to the current search library. This
setting is only required if the multiple Identity Providers need to be
supported but the *physical_loc* setting is inappropriate for choosing
the context location.

==== eg_vhost.conf

Shibboleth needs be enabled in *eg_vhost.conf*. Uncomment the two lines in eg_vhost.conf as follows:

.eg_vhost.conf
[source,xml]
....
<Location /eg/opac>
    # Uncomment the entries below to enable Shibboleth authentication
    AuthType shibboleth
    Require shibboleth
....

=== Shibboleth configuration

Configuring Shibboleth is particular to each institution's needs, and
depends on the IdP or IdPs that will be used. However, here are a couple sample configurations to use as examples.

==== Simple configuration that can support multiple IdPs

==== Other configuration information

Some common attribute maps that are useful for Microsoft ActiveDirectory
and UNIX LDAP IdPs that can be added to attribute-map.xml are:

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:1.2.840.113556.1.4.221" id="sAMAccountName"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1" id="uid"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3" id="mail"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:uid" id="uid"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail" id="mail"/>+`

For some IdPs, such as SimpleSAMLphp, it can be necessary to add a
special security policy to security-policy.xml:

[source,xml]
....
<Policy id="unsigned-slo">
    <PolicyRule type="NullSecurity"/>
</Policy>
....

==== Testing your configuration

To test if there is a current active Shibboleth session, go here:
`+https://<your-eg-hostname>/Shibboleth.sso/Session+`

For testing purposes, if you need to reset the browser so itâ€™s as if a
user has never logged in before, this can be done by clearing all
cookies associated with the Evergreen OPAC.
