= Single Sign On for Evergreen OPAC
:toc:

indexterm:[Authentication,Single Sign On,Identity Provider]

== Patron OPAC SSO

=== Introduction

The Single Sign On mechanism for the Evergreen OPAC adds the ability for
Evergreen to authenticate users against a configurable authoritative
external source, using Shibboleth.

Single Sign On systems are often used in academic institutions as a way
to authenticate students, faculty, and staff across a wide range of
separate digital services. The goal of a Single Sign On system is to
permit a user to log in with a single set of credentials across all of
these services. Each service talks to an Identity Provider (IdP) which
confirms that a given user is authorized to use the service. For
example, a college might be able to use an IdP to support a single login
which will authenticate a student to the library catalog, the school’s
collection of databases, and internal school services such as the
registrar.

This feature supports setting up separate Identity Providers within a
single Evergreen instance, and this is controlled via an Apache
VirtualHost configuration which is described in detail below.

This feature does not offer external authentication for the Evergreen
staff client.

=== Public Catalog Display

If a location has Single Sign On activated, by default a patron will be required to authenticate the Single Sign On service. In most cases the patron will be transparently redirected to the Single Sign On login. However, if a patron navigates directly to the URL `+https://<your.evergreen.domain>/eg/opac/login+`, they will be presented with a prompt redirecting them to the Single Sign On service:

image::sso/patron_sso_only.png[Redirect to Single Sign On]

If a location wishes to permit Evergreen-native authentication as well as Single Sign On authentication, the Library Setting *_Allow both Shibboleth and native OPAC authentication_* should be set to TRUE. In that case, a patron who navigates to the login page, or to a page requiring authentication, will see this:

image:sso/patron_sso_and_native.png[Single Sign on and native authentication permitted]

=== Permission and Library Settings

Users must have SSO_ADMIN permission assigned at the appropriate
working locations and depths in order to set or change any of the below
Library Settings.

Library settings are inheritable, unless there is an organizationally
closer setting.

* *Enable Shibboleth SSO for the OPAC*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Controls whether Shibboleth is being used.
* *Allow both Shibboleth and native OPAC authentication*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is false, which will redirect patrons to the configured Single
Sign On service.
** If set to true, patrons will still be presented with an Evergreen login
form when Single Sign On is enabled.
* *Log out of the Shibboleth IdP*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is false, which will leave a user logged into Shibboleth but
will forget their Evergreen authoken and set a cookie so they are logged
out of Evergreen until they choose to log back in.
** If set to true, the user will be logged out of Shibboleth when they log
out of Evergreen. Additionally, if the IdP implements the
SingleLogoutService option, the user will be logged out of the IdP as
well.
** This setting works on an intentional logout; a timeout behaves
differently (see below).
* *Shibboleth SSO Entity ID*
** Text
** Records which configured Entity ID to use for Single Sign On, if there
are multiple Identity Providers in use by a single Evergreen instance.
* *Evergreen SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which field carries the ID that Shibboleth is looking for.
Default is *usrname*, but also accepts *barcode* and *email* (note the
last is not a unique value in Evergreen).
* *Shibboleth SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which value is coming from Shibboleth that Evergreen will need
to look up a user. This is defined in the Shibboleth configuration and
defaults to *uid*.

Note that the existing Library Setting _OPAC Inactivity Timeout_ will
log a user out of Evergreen but not out of Shibboleth. Shibboleth has a
separate configured timeout value. If the user is logged out of
Evergreen due to a timeout, but is still logged in to Shibboleth, they
will be transparently reauthenticated to Evergreen when they select the
*MyAccount* button.

=== Apache Settings

In order to identify which location (i.e., Organizational Unit) is used
as the context location for Shibboleth-related library settings, the
*sso_loc* Apache variable can be set. This is configured per hostname in
exactly the same way as the *physical_loc* Apache variable. For example:

....
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ...
    SetEnv sso_loc 101
  # The following may be necessary based on how Shibboleth is configured
  <Location />
    ShibRequestSetting applicationId otheridp
  </Location>
  ...
</VirtualHost>
....

If *sso_loc* is not set, Evergreen will check for a *physical_loc*
setting, and finally, fall back to the current search library. This
setting is only required if the multiple Identity Providers need to be
supported but the *physical_loc* setting is inappropriate for choosing
the context location.

==== eg_vhost.conf

Shibboleth needs be enabled in *eg_vhost.conf*. Uncomment the two lines in eg_vhost.conf as follows:

.eg_vhost.conf
[source,xml]
....
<Location /eg/opac>
    # Uncomment the entries below to enable Shibboleth authentication
    AuthType shibboleth
    Require shibboleth
....

=== Shibboleth configuration

Configuring Shibboleth is particular to each institution's needs, and
depends on the IdP or IdPs that will be used. However, here are a couple sample configurations to use as examples.

==== Other configuration information

Some common attribute maps that are useful for Microsoft ActiveDirectory
and UNIX LDAP IdPs that can be added to attribute-map.xml are:

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:1.2.840.113556.1.4.221" id="sAMAccountName"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1" id="uid"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3" id="mail"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:uid" id="uid"/>+`

`+<Attribute name="urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail" id="mail"/>+`


For some IdPs, such as SimpleSAMLphp, it can be necessary to add a
special security policy to security-policy.xml:

[source,xml]
....
<Policy id="unsigned-slo">
    <PolicyRule type="NullSecurity"/>
</Policy>
....

=== Testing your configuration

To test if there is a current active Shibboleth session, go here:
`+https://<your-eg-hostname>/Shibboleth.sso/Session+`

For testing purposes, if you need to reset the browser so it’s as if a user has never logged in before, this can be done by clearing all cookies associated with the Evergreen OPAC. Using browser "incognito" or "private browsing" modes are recommended.

== Staff-Side Single Sign On

=== Introduction

Similar to the patron OPAC SSO, the staff single sign on is also available. The staff side and patron side SSO are not mutually exclusive. You can configure Evergreen to use one or the other or both. The staff side single sign on has a separate set of library settings as well as Apache/Shibboleth configuration. Special Apache/Shibboleth configuration blocks are required if you want Evergreen to handle both simultaneously.

=== Staff login experience

Evergreen staff single sign on uses the registered workstation (browser cookie) to determine whether or not the login page should offer single sign on. Staff will be required to login to the Evergreen staff client using their native Evergreen credentials at least once. This is required in order to register a workstation. If the computer/browser that you are using has already registered a workstation, then you will not be required to login with native Evergreen credentials. It's a good idea to remember your native Evergreen credentials in order to register a workstation in the future. If your computer is replaced, or you delete your browser cache, or you use a different browser, you will be required to register a workstation.

NOTE: It is possible to offer both native and single sign on the login page. This is governed by the library setting "*_Allow both Shibboleth and native Staff Client authentication_*"

=== Permission and Library Settings

Staff Single Sign On is controlled by several Evergreen Library Settings, and an Apache setting. Library settings are inheritable, unless there is an organizationally closer setting.

Users must have *_SSO_ADMIN_* permission assigned at the appropriate working locations and depths in order to set or change any of the below Library Settings.

* *Enable Shibboleth SSO for the Staff Client*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Controls whether Shibboleth is being used for staff.
* *Allow both Shibboleth and native Staff Client authentication*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is true. If true, the staff login portal will offer Evergreen native username/password boxes.
* *Log out of the Staff Shibboleth IdP*
** TRUE / FALSE
** Default is false, which will leave a user logged into Shibboleth but
will forget their Evergreen authoken and set a cookie so they are logged
out of Evergreen until they choose to log back in.
** If set to true, the user will be logged out of Shibboleth when they log
out of Evergreen. Additionally, if the IdP implements the
SingleLogoutService option, the user will be logged out of the IdP as
well.
** This setting works on an intentional logout; a timeout behaves
differently (see below).
* *Shibboleth Staff SSO Entity ID*
** Text
** Records which configured Entity ID to use for Single Sign On, if there
are multiple Identity Providers in use by a single Evergreen instance.
* *Evergreen Staff SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which field carries the ID that Shibboleth is looking for.
Default is *usrname*, but also accepts *barcode* and *email* (note the
last is not a unique value in Evergreen).
* *Shibboleth Staff SSO matchpoint*
** Text
** Indicates which value is coming from Shibboleth that Evergreen will need
to look up a user. This is defined in the Shibboleth configuration and
defaults to *uid*.
* *Specific Shibboleth Application path. Default /Shibboleth.sso*
** Text
** A Shibboleth technicality. If you are also configuring Patron SSO, you will want to edit this setting to match your staff Shibboleth Application path setting. (AKA "/sys1/staff/Shibboleth.sso")


=== Apache Settings

We need to teach Shibboleth about the specific application context using *_ShibRequestSetting_*. Here's an example Apache configuration for a system that has both Patron and Staff SSO configured:

....
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ...
############################
# Patron SSO portion BEGIN #
############################
SetEnv sso_loc 101
<Location />
	ShibRequestSetting applicationId sys1_patron

=== Other configuration information

Some common attribute maps that are useful for some IdPs and can be added to attribute-map.xml are:

`+<Attribute name="uid" id="uid" nameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic"/>`

`+<Attribute name="uid" id="uid" nameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified"/>`

=== Troubleshooting

It's common to see an "infinite loop" where the browser bounces to the IdP and back to Evergreen and back again. This is almost always due to the claim. The IdP needs to double check the claim settings. Make sure that the claim name is "uid" (or whatever you configured Evergreen to expect). You can check to see what claim you are receiving by navigating your browser to this URL manually:

`+https://sys1.example.org/sys1/staff/Shibboleth.sso/Session+`

Additionally, you can convey your Metadata to the IdP with this URL:

`+https://sys1.example.org/sys1/staff/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata+`
