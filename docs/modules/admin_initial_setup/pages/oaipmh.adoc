= OAI-PMH Data Provider Support =
:toc:

As of version 3.9 Evergreen can act as an OAI-PMH data provider, exposing the catalog to harvesting through the http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html[OAI2 protocol].

== Entry points ==

There are two entry points: one for bibliographic records and one for authority records:

`http://<your-domain>/opac/extras/oai/authority`

`http://<your-domain>/opac/extras/oai/biblio`


An example of a working URL on a system with an authority record with ID 1:

`http://<your-domain>/opac/extras/oai/authority?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:localhost:1&metadataPrefix=oai_dc`

== Setspec are partially implemented ==

Sets for bib records are currently based on copy visibility, Located URI visibility, or bib source.  Generally useful combinations are generated for item, Located URI, and transcendent bib sources.

Sets for authority records are based on the browse axis of the heading for the record.

All generated Sets for bib records currently test for effective search visibility on the three described components.

In order to retrieve item data from a specific branch of the org tree, a harvester must use a Set that contains `COPIES:`. The hierarchical shortnames of the org units follow the colon, so in a freshly installed system a Set with the setSpec of `COPIES:CONS:SYS2:BR3` will retrieve all bib records that have visible copies at BR3, and include only the item data for that org unit.

To retrieve records with Located URIs, which behave in the hierarchical reverse of copies by limiting display to those org units "inside" the branch of the tree where the licensing "lives", a harvester should supply a setSpec with an org unit shortname that would display the Located URI. For example: `LURIS:CONS:SYS2:BR3`

Note: the `LURI:` org unit is also used to restrict any item data that may be available for LURI-filtered records.

To retrieve records that are in a transcendent bib source, a harvester can used a setSpec starting with `SOURCES:` followed by the source name.

To harvest all records, including deleted records, simply omit the setSpec from the request.  All item data will be included.

To list available Sets, use the ListSets verb, for instance:

`http://your-domain/opac/extras/oai/biblio?verb=ListSets`

`http://your-domain/opac/extras/oai/authority?verb=ListSets`

== Bibliographic mapping of assets to 852 subfields ==

Certain attributes asset are placed into 852 subfields so:

|===
| subfield code | asset resource

| a | location
| b | owning_lib
| c | callnumber
| d | circlib
| g | barcode
| n | status
|===

Thus the Concerto with record ID 1 will have its 852 subfields expressed as:

[source,xml]
----
<marc:datafield ind1="4" ind2=" " tag="852">
    <marc:subfield code="a">Stacks</marc:subfield>
    <marc:subfield code="b">BR4</marc:subfield>
    <marc:subfield code="c">ML 60 R100</marc:subfield>
    <marc:subfield code="d">BR4</marc:subfield>
    <marc:subfield code="g">CONC70000435</marc:subfield>
    <marc:subfield code="n">Checked out</marc:subfield>
</marc:datafield>
----

This mapping can be customized and extended with static subfields:

[source,xml]
----
<marc:subfield code="q">A constant value</marc:subfield>
----

== Default configuration ==

See comments in `opensrf.xml` (in the `open-ils.supercat app_settings/oai` element) for default configuration and customization instructions.

== Upgrade instructions ==

OAI support is not turned on by default. To enable it, edit the Apache configuration file `eg_vhost.conf` to uncomment the following section and restart Apache:

[source,conf]
----
#<Location /opac/extras/oai>
#    SetHandler perl-script
#    PerlHandler OpenILS::WWW::SuperCat::OAI
#    Options +ExecCGI
#    PerlSendHeader On
#    Require all granted
#</Location>
