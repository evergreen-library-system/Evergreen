Many different members of your staff will use your Evergreen system to perform
the wide variety of tasks required of the library.

When the Evergreen installation was completed, a number of permission groups
should have been automatically created. These permission groups are:

* Users
* Patrons
* Staff
* Catalogers
* Circulators
* Acquisitions
* Acquisitions Administrator
* Cataloging Administrator
* Circulation Administrator
* Local Administrator
* Serials
* System Administrator
* Global Administrator
* Data Review
* Volunteers

Each of these permission groups has a different set of permissions connected to
them that allow them to do different things with the Evergreen system. Some of
the permissions are the same between groups; some are different. These
permissions are typically tied to one or more working location (sometimes
referred to as a working organizational unit or work OU) which affects where a
particular user can exercise the permissions they have been granted.

== Setting the staff user's working location ==
To grant a working location to a staff user in the staff client:

. Search for the patron. Select *Search > Search for Patrons* from the top menu.
. When you retrieve the correct patron record, select *Other > User Permission
  Editor* from the upper right corner. The permissions associated with this
  account appear in the right side of the client, with the *Working Location*
  list at the top of the screen.
. The *Working Location* list displays the Organizational Units in your
  consortium. Select the check box for each Organization Unit where this user
  needs working permissions. Clear any other check boxes for Organization Units
  where the user no longer requires working permissions.
. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and click *Save*. This user
  account is now ready to be used at your library.

As you scroll down the page you will come to the *Permissions* list. These are
the permissions that are given through the *Permission Group* that you assigned
to this user. Depending on your own permissions, you may also have the ability
to grant individual permissions directly to this user.

== Comparing approaches for managing permissions ==
The Evergreen community uses two different approaches to deal with managing
permissions for users:

* *Staff Client*
+
Evergreen libraries that are most comfortable using the staff client tend to
manage permissions by creating different profiles for each type of user. When
you create a new user, the profile you assign to the user determines their
basic set of permissions. This approach requires many permission groups that
contain overlapping sets of permissions: for example, you might need to create
a _Student Circulator_ group and a _Student Cataloger_ group. Then if a new
employee needs to perform both of these roles, you need to create a third
_Student Cataloger / Circulator_ group representing the set of all of the
permissions of the first two groups.
+
The advantage to this approach is that you can maintain the permissions
entirely within the staff client; a drawback to this approach is that it can be
challenging to remember to add a new permission to all of the groups. Another
drawback of this approach is that the user profile is also used to determine
circulation and hold rules, so the complexity of your circulation and hold
rules might increase significantly.
+
* *Database Access*
+
Evergreen libraries that are comfortable manipulating the database directly
tend to manage permissions by creating permission groups that reflect discrete
roles within a library. At the database level, you can make a user belong to
many different permission groups, and that can simplify your permission
management efforts. For example, if you create a _Student Circulator_ group and
a _Student Cataloger_ group, and a new employee needs to perform both of these
roles, you can simply assign them to both of the groups; you do not need to
create an entirely new permission group in this case. An advantage of this
approach is that the user profile can represent only the user's borrowing
category and requires only the basic _Patrons_ permissions, which can simplify
your circulation and hold rules.

Permissions and profiles are not carved in stone. As the system administrator,
you can change them as needed. You may set and alter the permissions for each
permission group in line with what your library, or possibly your consortium,
defines as the appropriate needs for each function in the library.

== Managing permissions in the staff client ==
In this section, we'll show you in the staff client:

* where to find the available permissions
* where to find the existing permission groups
* how to see the permissions associated with each group
* how to add or remove permissions from a group

We also provide an appendix with a listing of suggested minimum permissions for
some essential groups. You can compare the existing permissions with these
suggested permissions and, if any are missing, you will know how to add them.

=== Where to find existing permissions and what they mean ===
In the staff client, in the upper right corner of the screen, click on
*Administration > Server Administration > Permissions*.

The list of available permissions will appear on screen and you can scroll down
through them to see permissions that are already available in your default
installation of Evergreen.

There are over 500 permissions in the permission list. They appear in two
columns: *Code* and *Description*. Code is the name of the permission as it
appear in the Evergreen database. Description is a brief note on what the
permission allows. All of the most common permissions have easily
understandable descriptions.

=== Where to find existing Permission Groups ===
In the staff client, in the upper right corner of the screen, navigate to
*Administration > Server Administration > Permission Groups*.

Two panes will open on your screen. The left pane provides a tree view of
existing Permission Groups. The right pane contains two tabs: Group
Configuration and Group Permissions.

In the left pane, you will find a listing of the existing Permission Groups
which were installed by default. Click on the + sign next to any folder to
expand the tree and see the groups underneath it. You should see the Permission
Groups that were listed at the beginning of this chapter. If you do not and you
need them, you will have to create them.

=== Adding or removing permissions from a Permission Group ===
First, we will remove a permission from the Staff group.

. From the list of Permission Groups, click on *Staff*.
. In the right pane, click on the *Group Permissions* tab. You will now see a
  list of permissions that this group has.
. From the list, choose *CREATE_CONTAINER*. This will now be highlighted.
. Click the *Delete Selected* button. CREATE_CONTAINER will be deleted from the
  list. The system will not ask for a confirmation. If you delete something by
  accident, you will have to add it back.
. Click the *Save Changes* button.

You can select a group of individual items by holding down the _Ctrl_ key and
clicking on them. You can select a list of items by clicking on the first item,
holding down the _Shift_ key, and clicking on the last item in the list that
you want to select.

Now, we will add the permission we just removed back to the Staff group.

. From the list of Permission Groups, click on *Staff*.
. In the right pane, click on the *Group Permissions* tab.
. Click on the *New Mapping* button. The permission mapping dialog box will
  appear.
. From the Permission drop down list, choose *CREATE_CONTAINER*.
. From the Depth drop down list, choose *Consortium*.
. Click the checkbox for *Grantable*.
. Click the *Add Mapping* button. The new permission will now appear in the
  Group Permissions window.
. Click the *Save Changes* button.

If you have saved your changes and you don't see them, you may have to click
the Reload button in the upper left side of the staff client screen.

== Managing role-based permission groups in the staff client ==

Main permission groups are granted in the staff client through Edit in the patron record using the Main (Profile) Permission Group field.  Additional permission
groups can be granted using secondary permission groups.

[[secondaryperms]]
=== Secondary Group Permissions ===

The _Secondary Groups_ button functionality enables supplemental permission
groups to be added to staff accounts. The *CREATE_USER_GROUP_LINK* and
*REMOVE_USER_GROUP_LINK* permissions are required to display and use this
feature.

In general when creating a secondary permission group do not grant the
permission to login to Evergreen.

==== Granting Secondary Permissions Groups ====


. Open the account of the user you wish to grant secondary permission group to.
. Click _Edit_.
. Click _Secondary Groups_, located to the right of the _Main (Profile) Permission Group_.
+

== Managing role-based permission groups in the database ==
While the ability to assign a user to multiple permission groups has existed in
Evergreen for years, a staff client interface is not currently available to
facilitate the work of the Evergreen administrator. However, if you or members
of your team are comfortable working directly with the Evergreen database, you
can use this approach to separate the borrowing profile of your users from the
permissions that you grant to staff, while minimizing the amount of overlapping
permissions that you need to manage for a set of permission groups that would
otherwise multiply exponentially to represent all possible combinations of
staff roles.

In the following example, we create three new groups:

* a _Student_ group used to determine borrowing privileges
* a _Student Cataloger_ group representing a limited set of cataloging
  permissions appropriate for students
* a _Student Circulator_ group representing a limited set of circulation
  permissions appropriate for students

Then we add three new users to our system: one who needs to perform some
cataloging duties as a student; one who needs perform some circulation duties
as a student; and one who needs to perform both cataloging and circulation
duties. This section demonstrates how to add these permissions to the users at
the database level.

To create the Student group, add a new row to the _permission.grp_tree_ table
as a child of the _Patrons_ group:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO permission.grp_tree (name, parent, usergroup, description, application_perm)
SELECT 'Students', pgt.id, TRUE, 'Student borrowers', 'group_application.user.patron.student'
FROM permission.grp_tree pgt
 WHERE name = 'Patrons';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the Student Cataloger group, add a new row to the
_permission.grp_tree_ table as a child of the _Staff_ group:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO permission.grp_tree (name, parent, usergroup, description, application_perm)
SELECT 'Student Catalogers', pgt.id, TRUE, 'Student catalogers', 'group_application.user.staff.student_cataloger'
FROM permission.grp_tree pgt
WHERE name = 'Staff';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create the Student Circulator group, add a new row to the
_permission.grp_tree_ table as a child of the _Staff_ group:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO permission.grp_tree (name, parent, usergroup, description, application_perm)
SELECT 'Student Circulators', pgt.id, TRUE, 'Student circulators', 'group_application.user.staff.student_circulator'
FROM permission.grp_tree pgt
WHERE name = 'Staff';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to give the Student Catalogers group the ability to work with MARC
records at the consortial level, so we assign the UPDATE_MARC, CREATE_MARC, and
IMPORT_MARC permissions at depth 0:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH pgt AS (
  SELECT id
  FROM permission.grp_tree
  WHERE name = 'Student Catalogers'
)
INSERT INTO permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth)
SELECT pgt.id, ppl.id, 0
FROM permission.perm_list ppl, pgt
WHERE ppl.code IN ('UPDATE_MARC', 'CREATE_MARC', 'IMPORT_MARC');
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, we want to give the Student Circulators group the ability to check
out items and record in-house uses at the system level, so we assign the
COPY_CHECKOUT and CREATE_IN_HOUSE_USE permissions at depth 1 (overriding the
same _Staff_ permissions that were granted only at depth 2):

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH pgt AS (
  SELECT id
  FROM permission.grp_tree
  WHERE name = 'Student Circulators'
) INSERT INTO permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth)
SELECT pgt.id, ppl.id, 1
FROM permission.perm_list ppl, pgt
WHERE ppl.code IN ('COPY_CHECKOUT', 'CREATE_IN_HOUSE_USE');
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, we want to add our students to the groups. The request may arrive in
your inbox from the library along the lines of "Please add Mint Julep as a
Student Cataloger, Bloody Caesar as a Student Circulator, and Grass Hopper as a
Student Cataloger / Circulator; I've already created their accounts and given
them a work organizational unit." You can translate that into the following SQL
to add the users to the pertinent permission groups, adjusting for the
inevitable typos in the names of the users.

First, add our Student Cataloger:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH pgt AS (
  SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree
  WHERE name = 'Student Catalogers'
)
INSERT INTO permission.usr_grp_map (usr, grp)
SELECT au.id, pgt.id
FROM actor.usr au, pgt
WHERE first_given_name = 'Mint' AND family_name = 'Julep';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, add the Student Circulator:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH pgt AS (
  SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree
  WHERE name = 'Student Circulators'
)
INSERT INTO permission.usr_grp_map (usr, grp)
SELECT au.id, pgt.id
FROM actor.usr au, pgt
WHERE first_given_name = 'Bloody' AND family_name = 'Caesar';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, add the all-powerful Student Cataloger / Student Circulator:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WITH pgt AS (
  SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree
  WHERE name IN ('Student Catalogers', 'Student Circulators')
)
INSERT INTO permission.usr_grp_map (usr, grp)
SELECT au.id, pgt.id
FROM actor.usr au, pgt
WHERE first_given_name = 'Grass' AND family_name = 'Hopper';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While adopting this role-based approach might seem labour-intensive when
applied to a handful of students in this example, over time it can help keep
the permission profiles of your system relatively simple in comparison to the
alternative approach of rapidly reproducing permission groups, overlapping
permissions, and permissions granted on a one-by-one basis to individual users.
