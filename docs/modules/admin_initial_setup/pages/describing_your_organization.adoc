Your Evergreen system is almost ready to go. You'll need to add each of the
libraries that will be using your Evergreen system. If you're doing this for a
consortium, you'll have to add your consortium as a whole, and all the
libraries and branches that are members of the consortium. In this chapter,
we'll talk about how to get the Evergreen system to see all your libraries, how
to set each one up, and how to edit all the details of each one. 

== Organization Unit Types ==

The term _Organization Unit Types_ refers to levels in the hierarchy of your
library system(s). Examples could include: All-Encompassing Consortium, Library
System, Branch, Bookmobile, Sub-Branch, etc. 

You can add or remove organization unit types, and rename them as needed to
match the organizational hierarchy that matches the libraries using your
installation of Evergreen. Organization unit types should never have proper
names since they are only generic types. 

When working with configuration, settings, and permissions, it is very
important to be careful of the Organization Unit *Context Location* - this is the
organizational unit to which the configuration settings are being applied. If,
for example, a setting is applied at the Consortium context location, all child
units will inherit that setting. If a specific branch location is selected,
only that branch and its child units will have the setting applied. The levels
of the hierarchy to which settings can be applied are often referred to in
terms of "depth" in various configuration interfaces. In a typical hierarchy,
the consortium has a depth of 0, the system is 1, the branch is 2, and any
bookmobiles or sub-branches is 3.

=== Create and edit Organization Unit Types ===

To create or add an organization unit type, go to *Administration* > *Server Administration* > *Organization Types*. 

In the left panel, expand the *Organization Unit Types* hierarchy and click on an organization type to open the form in the right panel. The form displays the data for the selected organization unit type.

To edit the selected organization unit type, click *Edit*.

image::describing_your_organization/org-unit-type-edit.png[Organization unit type record edit button]

This will open up the Record Editor. Make the necessary updates and click *Save*.

image::describing_your_organization/org-unit-type-record-editor.png[Organization unit type record editor]

To create a new dependent organization unit type, click *Add Child*. 

This will bring up the Record Editor screen. Fill out the required fields and click *Save*.

image::describing_your_organization/org-unit-type-add-child.png[Organization unit type add child button]

The new child organization unit type will appear in the left panel list below the parent type. The option will also display in the Organization Unit Type field within the Organizational Units interface.

=== Permissions ===

The following permissions are needed to manage Organization Unit Types:

* CREATE_ORG_TYPE
* UPDATE_ORG_TYPE
* DELETE_ORG_TYPE


== Organizational Units ==

*Organizational Units* are the specific instances of the organization unit types that make up your library’s hierarchy. These will have distinctive proper names such as Main Street Branch or Townsville Campus.

=== Remove or edit default Organizational Units ===

After installing the Evergreen software, the default CONS, SYS1, BR1, etc., organizational units remain. These must be removed or edited to reflect actual library entities.

=== Create and edit Organizational Units ===

Organizational units are created and edited through *Administration* > *Server Administration* > *Organizational Units*.

The left panel shows a list of current Organizational Units and their hierarchy. Selecting a unit opens a form in the right panel, which displays the data for the selected organizational unit.

When creating a new organizational unit, all three tabs must be completed: *Main Settings*, *Hours of Operation*, and *Addresses*.

To create a new dependent organizational unit, click *Add Child*. 

image:describing_your_organization/org-unit-add-child.png[Organizational unit add child button]

This will open up a blank form. Input the library information for all three tabs, clicking Save after completing each tab. The same process is followed when editing any organizational unit data. 	

==== Organizational Unit data ====

The *Main Settings* tab is where you input the organization unit type, name(s), and contact information. The phone number and email address are used in patron email notifications, hold slips, and transit slips. This is also where you can control whether the organizational unit is visible in the OPAC. Note that all required fields must be filled out and saved before you can access the *Hours of Operation* and *Addresses* tabs.

image::describing_your_organization/org-unit-main-settings.png[Organizational unit main settings]

The *Hours of Operation* tab is where you enter regular, weekly hours. Holiday and other closures are set in the *Closed Dates Editor*. Hours of operation and closed dates impact due dates and fine accrual. When an organizational unit is first created, the hours default to 9 AM to 5 PM each day.

To add or edit hours: 

. Click on the *Hours of Operation* tab.
. Enter the updated hours for open and closed times for each day. 
. To indicate that a branch is closed on a certain day, click the *Closed* button next to that day. The hours will default to 12:00 AM in both the open and closed fields. (If a library is already listed as closed on a certain day, the Closed button will be grayed out.)
. Click *Apply Changes*.

There is also the capability to add notes to each day’s hours to record split hours or other service-related information. The notes appear enclosed in parentheses next to each day’s hours when viewing a library’s hours in the Bootstrap OPAC and TPAC.

To add hours of operation notes:

. Click the checkbox under *Edit Note Field?*. Note that all subsequent boxes will be checked, and a notes field will appear under each day.
. Type in the note for the corresponding day.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

To delete (clear) hours, click *Clear Hours of Operation*. The hours will revert to the default times, and an alert will appear stating the hours have not been saved.

The *Addresses* tab is broken out into four address types: *Physical Address*, *Holds Address*, *Mailing Address*, *ILL Address*. Click *Save* in each address tab after adding or editing addresses.

image::describing_your_organization/org_unit_addresses.png[Organizational unit addresses]

If you are offering geographic location service for your catalog, you can also set the longitude and latitude coordinates under any of the addresses screens.

If library settings have geographic location service enabled, then you could type in the address, click *Get Coordinates* for the fields to autofill.  You can also set the coordinates manually.

=== After Changing Organizational Unit Data ===

After you change Organizational Unit data, you must run the autogen.sh script.  
This script updates the Evergreen organization tree and fieldmapper IDL.  
You will get unpredictable results if you don't run this after making changes.

Run this script as the *opensrf* Linux account.

[source, bash]

=== Permissions ===

Each tab within the organizational unit configuration requires different permissions to manage the data.

To create an organizational unit and manage the Main Settings:

* CREATE_ORG_UNIT
* UPDATE_ORG_UNIT
* DELETE_ORG_UNIT


To manage Addresses:

* CREATE_ORG_ADDRESS
* UPDATE_ORG_ADDRESS
* DELETE_ORG_ADDRESS

[NOTE]
====
There is a current bug for the DELETE_ORG_ADDRESS permission where it is not required to delete an address. To delete an address, only the UPDATE_ORG_UNIT permission is needed at this time.
====

To manage Hours of Operation:

* CREATE_HOURS_OF_OPERATION
* UPDATE_HOURS_OF_OPERATION
* DELETE_HOURS_OF_OPERATION
