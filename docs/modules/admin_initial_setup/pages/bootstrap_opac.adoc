= Bootstrap-based OPAC =

As of version 3.6, the Boostrap OPAC (BOOPAC) is the default.

Enable or disable the Bootstrap OPAC in the the `/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf` file.

Find the following line:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates"
----

Add the following line directly below it to if not already present:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates-bootstrap"
----

Be sure that, if you have any local customizations, that they are referenced below
this line.  This way, your customizations will still appear in the Bootstrap OPAC design
(although they may need to be adjusted to better fit the new style).

You can also turn on the Boostrap OPAC for some virtual hosts only, by adding it to the
appropriate virtual host entry.  Be sure to reference the OILSWebTemplatePath for
the `templates-bootstrap` directory before referencing any local customizations
used by that virtual host.
