= Curbside Pickup for Evergreen =
:toc:

The Curbside Pickup features in Evergreen provides an interface to help facilitate contact free pickup of library materials.  It provides a dedicated interface in the staff client for library staff to track and manage curbside pickup appointments and materials through the various stages of the process.  Staff can schedule pickup appointments on behalf of patrons.  Optionally, this feature can also allow patrons to schedule their own curbside pickup appointments in their OPAC account, as well as inform the library when they have arrived and are waiting for their materials.  

Things to know about curbside pickup:

* It is an extension of the existing holds functionality in Evergreen.  A hold must be placed for an item to be eligible for curbside pickup.  After an item has been captured for a hold and is available for pickup from the holds shelf, a curbside pickup appointment can be scheduled to allow the materials to be obtained in a contact free transaction.
* It can accommodate several different workflows depending on how your library decides to implement curbside pickup.  It can help library staff track and checkout batches of items to be picked up curbside and help facilitate communication between library staff and patrons.  It does not prescribe a specific workflow for curbside pickup.  Several workflow options are described below.  
* It can be used alongside regular (in the library) hold pickup.  Curbside pickup can be an option you offer your patrons in addition to regular pickup or it can be the primary pickup option depending on your library’s current service plan.
* It assumes the library will have a staff member assigned to managing curbside pickup throughout the day.
* It assumes that patrons with appointments will have their items checked out from the Curbside interface, and not from the standard checkout interface. If a patron has a Curbside appointment, and a staff member checks out items from the main checkout interface, this can lead to an “empty” appointment in the Curbside interface.
* It is an optional feature and needs to be enabled for use (instructions below).

* How to configure curbside pickup for your library
* An overview of the staff-facing interface 
* An overview of the patron-facing OPAC My Account interfaces
* Workflow options for using curbside pickup

[[enabling_configuring_curbside_pickup]]
== Enabling and Configuring Curbside Pickup ==

The curbside pickup feature is enabled and configured in the *Library Settings Editor* (Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor).

There are four new Library Settings related to curbside pickup.  They can be easily located by searching for the term ‘curb’ or ‘curbside’ in the Library Settings Editor:

* Circulation: Enable curbside pickup functionality at library.
** When set to TRUE patrons will have the ability to schedule curbside pickup of holds that become available for pickup.
** Set to True to enable the Curbside Pickup feature.  
** This will provide patrons with the ability to schedule curbside pickup of holds that become available for pickup and will make Curbside Pickup  an option in the Circulation menu of the staff interface.
** This feature can be enabled at the consortium, system, or library branch levels.
* Circulation: Disable patron modification of curbside appointments in public catalog
** When set to TRUE, patrons cannot use the My Account interface to select curbside pickup times, and are directed to contact the pickup library.
** Patrons can still view the curbside pickup appointment times they have scheduled (via library staff) but they will not be able to modify the appointments through their My Account.  
* Circulation: Maximum number of patrons that may select a particular curbside pickup time
** Set to the maximum number of patrons that may select a particular curbside pickup time.  
** This allows your library to control the flow of your curbside pickup by limiting the number of patrons that can choose the same pick up time slot.
* Circulation: Time interval between curbside appointments
** Select the amount of time designated for each appointment.  Setting this to 15 minutes means appointment slots will be designated every 15 minutes starting on the hour. E.g. 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, 10:45 etc.
** Note:  appointment times will correspond to the library’s Hours of Operation.  Available time slots will not include the time the library closes.  For example, if your library is set to close at 6 pm and your curbside pickup time slots are 15 minutes, the last available pickup time will be 5:45 pm.

NOTE: Currently curbside pickup appointment times are based solely on the Hours of Operation that are configured in Administration>Server Administration>Organizational Units.  Curbside DOES take into account closed dates set in the Closed Dates Editor.

[[curbside_notifications_action_triggers]]
== Notifications and Action Triggers ==

There are several new patron notice options related to curbside pickup.  These notices can be enabled and customized as needed if your library uses curbside pickup.  Notices are configured in *Administration -> Local Administration -> Notifications/Action Triggers*.

When a patron’s holds are marked as ready for pickup in Evergreen, an email or text/SMS notification can be sent to let them know that curbside pickup is an option at their library.  This notice can be used to promote this service and the default message will prompt patrons to log in to their OPAC account to schedule an appointment or call the library to schedule an appointment.  The notice message is customizable.  

* The Trigger Event Definitions for this notice are called:
** Curbside offer Email notification, triggered by CurbsideSlot reactor on a definition attached to the hold available hook
** Curbside offer SMS notification, triggered by CurbsideSlot reactor on a definition attached to the hold available hook

*Curbside offer email - example*

image::curbside/curbside_offer_email.png[Curbside offer email]

*Curbside offer SMS - example*

image::curbside/curbside_offer_sms.png[Curbside offer SMS]

If a patron has scheduled a curbside pickup appointment, an email or text/SMS notification can be sent to confirm the appointment.  This confirmation is not related to any specific hold or holds, but rather the appointment they requested, and does not use the hold-specific SMS or email notification settings.  Therefore, if the SMS notification is enabled, and the patron has SMS settings, they will receive an SMS notification.  Likewise for the email confirmation option.  It can prompt them to log into their account or call the library in order to alert staff that they have arrived for their pickup appointment.  The notice message is customizable.  

* The Trigger Event Definitions for this notice are called:
** Curbside confirmation Email notification
** Curbside confirmation SMS notification

*Curbside confirmation email - example*

image::curbside/curbside_confirm_email.png[Curbside confirmation email]

*Curbside confirmation SMS - example*

image::curbside/curbside_confirm_sms.png[Curbside confirmation SMS]

Patrons can receive an email with a list of the items they checked out.  To receive this notice patrons must have an email address associated with their account.  This is an existing notice in Evergreen, used by the circulation interface to send email receipts on demand, that the curbside pickup workflow now also makes use of. 

* The Trigger Event Definition for this notice is called:
** Email Checkout Receipt

There is another action trigger called “Trigger curbside offer events and create a placeholder for the patron, where applicable”.  This action trigger does not send a notice to patrons or staff.  It is a silent action behind the scenes that initiates the curbside offer email or SMS notification described above.

== Using Curbside Pickup ==

=== Staff Interface Overview ===

When the feature is enabled in the Library Settings Editor, the Curbside Pickup interface can be accessed under *Circulation -> Curbside Pickup* (at the bottom of the menu).

This interface has five tabs that help staff manage the curbside pickup workflow through the various stages.  This interface is scoped to display only appointments at the library or organizational unit that your workstation is registered to. 

There are several workflows that can be accommodated by this feature.  Please see further down in this document for examples of curbside workflows.  This section of the documentation will discuss the functionality of the interface.

==== To Be Staged ====

* The *To Be Staged* tab shows a list of upcoming pickups during the next two pickup time slots.

The appointment will also appear in the Patron Is Outside tab with an alert that the items are not yet staged.
*** Potential alert: If the patron has a condition that would forbid them from checking out items such as a standing penalty, being barred, or having their privileges expired, an alert will appear under the patron name saying that they are blocked from checkouts. Buttons in the Action column will be disabled until the condition blocking the patron is resolved.
** Appointment ID:  unique number associated with the appointment
