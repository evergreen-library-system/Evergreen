== Placing Holds ==

Holds can be placed by staff in the _Staff Client_ and by patrons in the OPAC. In this chapter we demonstrate placing holds in the _Staff Client_.

== Holds Levels ==

Evergreen has different levels of holds. Library staff can place holds at all levels, while patrons can only place title-level holds, and parts-level holds. The chart below summarizes the levels of holds.

|==============================
|*Hold level* |*Abbreviation* |*When to use*        |*How to use*   |*Who can use*    |*Hold tied to*
|Title        |T              |Patron wants first available copy of a title  | Staff or patron click on _Place Hold_ next to title. | Patron or staff | Holdings attached to a single MARC (title) record
|Parts        |P              |Patron wants a particular part of title (e.g. volume or disk number)    | Staff or patron selects part on the create/edit hold screen when setting holds notification options.   |Patron or staff  |Holdings with identical parts attached to a single MARC (title) record.
|Volume       |V              |Patron or staff want any title associated with a particular call number | In the staff client, click on _Volume Hold_ under _Holdable?_ |Staff only |Holdings attached to a single call number (volume)
|Copy         |C              |Patron or staff want a specific copy of an item |In the staff client, click on _Copy Hold_ under _Holdable?_ |Staff only |A specific copy (barcode)
|==============================


== Title Level Hold ==

[TIP]
====================
A default hold expiration date will be displayed if the library has set up a default holds expiration period in their library settings. Uncaptured holds will not be targeted after the expiration date.

If you select the _Suspend this Hold_ checkbox, the hold will be suspended and not be captured until you activate it.
====================

. To place a title level hold, retrieve the title record on the catalog and click the _Place Hold_ link beside the title on the search results list, or click the _Place Hold_ link on the title summary screen.
+
image::media/holds_title_searchresults.png[Search Results with Place Hold link]
+
. Scan or type patron's barcode into the _Place hold for patron by
barcode_ box, or choose _Place this hold for me_.
. If this title contains multiple parts, you can specify which part to
request. If you do not select a part, the hold will target any of the
other copies on this record, that is, those with no parts attached.
Those copies are usually the complete set, containing all the parts.
. Edit patron hold notification and expiration date fields as required.
Be sure to choose a valid _Pickup location_.
. Click _Submit_.
+
image::media/holds_title_options.png[Place Holds screen with Basic Options]
+
. A confirmation screen appears with the message "Hold was successfully placed".
+
image::media/holds_title_success.png[Place Holds confirmation screen]

*Advanced Hold Options*

Clicking the *Advanced Hold Options* link will take you into the
metarecord level hold feature, where you can select multiple formats
and/or languages, if available.

Selecting multiple formats will not place all of these formats on hold.
For example, selecting CD Audiobook and Book implies that either the CD
format or the book format is the acceptable format to fill the hold. If
no format is selected, then any of the available formats may be used to
fill the hold. The same holds true for selecting multiple languages.

image::media/holds_title_options_adv.png[Place Hold screen with Advanced Options]


== Patron Search from Place Hold ==
Patron Search from Place Hold allows staff members, when placing a hold on behalf of a patron in the web staff client, to search for patrons by names and other searchable patron information, rather than relying on barcode alone.


=== To use Patron Search From Place Holds: ===
1. After performing a search in the catalog, staff will retrieve a bibliographic record.
2. Click *Place Hold* either in the search results or within the detailed bibliographic record. The Place Hold Screen will appear. Note: this feature also appears when placing volume level holds and copy level holds.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-0.JPG[]
+
3. Next to _Place Hold for patron by barcode_, click on *Patron Search*. Please note that Patron Search will only appear in this interface when using the web-based staff client.  It will not appear in the patron-facing OPAC.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-1.JPG[]
+
4. A dialog box will appear with the patron search interface used elsewhere in the staff client. By default, the search scopes to your workstation org unit, and you can search by patron last name, first name, and middle name.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-2.JPG[]
+
Clicking the *arrow icon* to the right of _Clear Form_ can either expand or condense the searchable fields display which includes other patron information.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-3.JPG[]
+
5. To search for a patron, fill out the relevant search fields, and click *Search* or hit ENTER on your keyboard. Results will appear below in Patron Search Results in the lower half of the screen.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-4.JPG[]
+
6. Click the row of the desired patron account, and click *Select*.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-5.JPG[]
+
7. The dialog box will close and the selected patron's barcode will appear next to _Place Hold for patron by barcode_. This will cause the patron's hold notification preferences to appear in the relevant fields in the bottom half of the screen. Changes to the Hold Notification preferences can be made before clicking *Submit* to finish placing a hold for the patron.
+
image::media/PlaceHold-6.JPG[]

== Parts Level Hold ==

. To place a parts level hold, retrieve a record with parts-level items
attached to the title, such as a multi-disc DVD, an annual travel guide,
or a multi-volume book set.
. Place the hold as you would for a title-level hold, including patron
barcode, notification details, and a valid pickup location.
. Select the applicable part from the _Select a Part_ dropdown menu.
. Click _Submit_.
+
image::media/holds_title_options.png[Place Holds screen with Basic Options]
+
[TIP]
===============
Requested formats are listed in the _Holdable Part_ column in hold records. Use the _Column Picker_ to display it when the hold record is displayed.
===============

== Placing Holds in Patron Records ==

. Holds can be placed from patron records too. In the patron record on the _Holds_ screen, click the _Place Hold_ button on the left top corner.

. The catalog is displayed in the _Holds_ screen to search for the title on which you want to place a hold.

. Search for the title and click the _Place Hold_ link.

. The patron’s account information is retrieved automatically. Set up the notification and expiration date fields. Click _Place Hold_ and confirm your action in the pop-up window.

. You may continue to search for more titles. Once you are done, click the _Holds_ button on the top to go back to the _Holds_ screen. Click the _Refresh_ button to display your newly placed holds.

=== Placing Multiple Holds on Same Title ===

After a successful hold placement, staff have the option to place another hold on the same title by clicking the link _Place another hold for this title_.  This returns to the hold screen, where a different patron's information can be entered.

image::media/place-another-hold-1.png[place-another-hold-1]

This feature can be useful for book groups or new items where a list of waiting patrons needs to be transferred into the system.


== Managing Holds ==

Holds can be cancelled at any time by staff or patrons. Before holds are captured, staff or patrons can suspend them or set them as inactive for a period of time without losing the hold queue position, activate suspended holds, phone number, pick-up location (for multi-branch libraries only), expiration date, activation date for inactive holds, etc. Once a hold is captured, staff can change the pickup location and extend the hold shelf time if required.

As of 3.6, staff and patrons can update hold notification preferences on unfulfilled holds. For more information see xref:circulation:circulation_patron_records_web_client.adoc#update_hold_notifications[Update Notification Preferences].

Staff can edit holds in either patron’s records or the title records. Patrons can edit their holds in their account on the OPAC.

[TIP]
==============
If you use the column picker to change the holds display from one area of the staff client (e.g. the patron record), it will change the display for all parts of the staff client that deal with holds, including the title record holds
display, the holds shelf display, and the pull list display.
==============


[#actions_for_selected_holds]
=== Actions for Selected Holds ===

. Retrieve the patron record and go to the _Holds_ screen.

example, you can retrieve the hold requestor’s account by selecting
_Retrieve Patron_ from this menu.
+
image::media/holds-managing-19.png[holds-managing-19]


=== Retargeting Holds ===

Holds need to be retargeted whenever a new item is added to a record, or after some types of item status changes, for instance when an item is changed from _On Order_ to _In Process_. The system does not automatically recognize the newly added items as available to fill holds.

. View the holds for the item.

. Highlight all the holds for the record, which have a status of _Waiting for Copy_. If there are a lot of holds, it may be helpful to sort the holds by _Status_.

. Click on the head of the status column.

. Under _Actions_, select _Find Another Target_.

. A window will open asking if you are sure you would like to reset the holds for these items.

. Click _Yes_. Nothing may appear to happen, or if you are retargeting a lot of holds at once, your screen may go blank or seem to freeze for a moment while the holds are retargeted.

. When the screen refreshes, the holds will be retargeted. The system will now recognize the new items as available for holds.


=== Pulling & Capturing Holds ===

==== Holds Pull List ====

There are usually four statuses a hold may have: _Waiting for Copy_, _Waiting for Capture_, _In Transit_ and _Ready for Pickup_.

. *Waiting-for-copy*: all holdable copies are checked out or not available.

. *Waiting-for-capture*: an available copy is assigned to the hold. The item shows up on the _Holds Pull List_ waiting for staff to search the shelf and capture the hold.

. *In Transit*: holds are captured at a non-pickup branch and on the way to the pick-up location.

. *Ready-for-pick-up*: holds are captured and items are on the _Hold Shelf_ waiting for patrons to pick up. Besides capturing holds when checking in items, Evergreen matches holds with available items in your library at regular
intervals. Once a matching copy is found, the item’s barcode number is assigned to the hold and the item is put on the _Holds Pull List_. Staff can print the _Holds Pull List_ and search for the items on shelves.

. To retrieve your _Holds Pull List_, select _Circulation_ -> _Pull List for Hold Requests_.
+
image::media/holds-pull-1.png[holds-pull-1]
+
. The _Holds Pull List_ is displayed. You may re-sort it by clicking the column labels, e.g. _Title_. You can also add fields to the display by using the column picker.
+
image::media/holds-pull-2.png[holds-pull-2]
+
[NOTE]
===========
Column adjustments will only affect the screen display and the CSV download for the holds pull list. It will not affect the printable holds pull list.
===========

. The following options are available for printing the pull list:

* _Print Full Pull List_ prints _Title_, _Author_, _Shelving Location_, _Call Number_ and _Item Barcode_. This method uses less paper than the alternate strategy.

* _Print Full Pull List (Alternate Strategy)_ prints the same fields as the above option but also includes a patron barcode. This list will also first sort by copy location, as ordered under _Admin_ -> _Local Administration_ -> _Copy Location Order_.

* _Download CSV_ – This option is available from the _List Actions_ button (adjacent to the _Page "#"_ button) and saves all fields in the screen display to a CSV file. This file can then be opened in Excel or another spreadsheet program. This option provides more flexibility in identifying fields that should be printed.
+
image::media/holds-pull-4.png[holds-pull-4]
+
With the CSV option, if you are including barcodes in the holds pull list, you will need to take the following steps to make the barcode display properly: in Excel, select the entire barcode column, right-click and select _Format Cells_, click _Number_ as the category and then reduce the number of decimal places to 0.

. You may perform hold management tasks by using the _Actions_ dropdown list.

The _Holds Pull List_ is updated constantly. Once an item on the list is no longer available or a hold on the list is captured, the items will disappear from the list. The _Holds Pull List_ should be printed at least once a day.

==== Capturing Holds ====

Holds can be captured when a checked-out item is returned (checked in) or an item on the _Holds Pull List_ is retrieved and captured. When a hold is captured, the hold slip will be printed and if the patron has chosen to be notified by email, the email notification will be sent out. The item should be put on the hold shelf.

. To capture a hold, select _Circulation_ -> _Capture Holds_ (or press
_Shift-F2_).
+
image::media/holds-pull-5.png[holds-pull-5]
+
. Scan or type barcode and click _Submit_.
+
image::media/holds-pull-6.png[holds-pull-6]
+
. The following hold slip is automatically printed. If your workstation
is not setup for silent printing (via Hatch), then a print window will appear.
+
image::media/holds-pull-7.png[holds-pull-7]
+
. If the item should be sent to another location, a hold transit slip
will be printed. If your workstation is not setup for silent printing
(via Hatch), then another print window will appear.
+
[TIP]
===============
If a patron has an _OPAC/Staff Client Holds Alias_ in his/her account, it will be used on the hold slip instead of the patron’s name. Holds can also be captured on the _Circulation_ -> _Check In Items_ screen where you have more control over automatic slip printing.
===============


=== Handling Missing and Damaged Items ===

If an item on the holds pull list is missing or damaged, you can change its status directly from the holds pull list.

. From the _Holds Pull List_, right-click on the item and either select _Mark Item Missing_ or _Mark Item Damaged_.
+
image::media/holds-pull-9.png[holds-pull-9]
+
. Evergreen will update the status of the item and will immediately retarget the hold.


=== Holds Notification Methods ===

. In Evergreen, patrons can set up their default holds notification method in the _Account Preferences_ area of _My Account_. Staff cannot set these preferences for patrons; the patrons must do it when they are logged into the public catalog.
+
image::media/holds-notifications-1.png[holds-notifications-1]
+
. Patrons with a default notification preference for phone will see their phone number at the time they place a hold. The checkboxes for email and phone notification will also automatically be checked (if an email or phone number has been assigned to the account).
+
image::media/holds-notifications-2.png[holds-notifications-2]
+
. The patron can remove these checkmarks at the time they place the hold or they can enter a different phone number if they prefer to be contacted at a different number. The patron cannot change their e-mail address at this time.

. A patron can update their hold notification preferences any time before a hold is fulfilled. See xref:circulation:circulation_patron_records_web_client.adoc#update_hold_notifications_opac[Update Notification Preferences in the OPAC] for more information.

. When the hold becomes available, the holds slip will display the patron’s e-mail address only if the patron selected the _Notify by Email by default when a hold is ready for pickup?_ checkbox. It will display a phone number only if the patron selected the _Notify by Phone by default when a hold is ready for pickup?_ checkbox.

[NOTE]
If the patron changes their contact telephone number when placing the hold, this phone number will display on the holds slip. It will not necessarily be the same phone number contained in the patron’s record.


=== Clearing Shelf-Expired Holds ===

. Items with _Ready-for-Pickup_ status are on the _Holds Shelf_. The _Holds Shelf_ can help you manage items on the holds shelf. To see the holds shelf list, select _Circulation_ -> _Holds Shelf_.
+
image::media/holds-clearing-1.png[holds-clearing-1]
+
. The _Holds Shelf_ is displayed. Note the _Actions_ menu is available, as in the patron record.
+
You can cancel stale holds here.
+
image::media/holds-clearing-2.png[holds-clearing-2]
+
. Use the column picker to add and remove fields from this display. Two fields you may want to display are _Shelf Expire Time_ and _Shelf Time_.
+
image::media/holds-clearing-3.png[holds-clearing-3]
+
. Click the _Show Clearable Holds_ button to list expired holds, wrong-shelf holds and canceled holds only. Expired holds are holds that expired before today's date.
+
image::media/holds-clearing-4.png[holds-clearing-4]
+
. Click the _Print Full List_ button if you need a printed list. To format the printout customize the *Holds Shelf* receipt template. This can be done in _Administration_ -> _Workstation_ -> _Print Templates_.

. The _Clear These Holds_ button becomes enabled when viewing clearable
holds. Click it and the expired holds will be canceled.

. Bring items down from the hold shelf and check them in.

[IMPORTANT]
=============
If you cancel a ready-for-pickup hold, you must check in the item to make it available for circulation or trigger the next hold in line.
=============

Hold shelf expire time is inserted when a hold achieves on-hold-shelf status. It is calculated based on the interval entered in _Local Admin_ -> _Library Settings_ -> _Default hold shelf expire interval_.

[NOTE]
===========
The clear-hold-shelf function cancels shelf-expired holds only. It does not include holds canceled by patron. Staff needs to trace these items manually according to the hold slip date.
===========

[[managing_hopeless_holds]]
== Managing Hopeless Holds ==

Unfulfillable holds are colloquially known as “hopeless holds.”  In previous versions of Evergreen, staff relied on reports to generate lists of unfulfillable holds.  New improvements are intended to provide staff with an easy way to retrieve a list of unfulfillable (“hopeless”) holds and perform actions on them to move them out of their hopeless condition.

=== Identifying a Hopeless Hold ===

A hold is considered hopeless when there are no copies in `hold_copy_map` or when all copies in `hold_copy_map` are in a item status with the new `hopeless_prone` property set to “True.”  

[[hopeless_prone_item_status_property]]
=== Hopeless Prone Item Status Property ===

Item statuses have an additional property available called “hopeless prone,” indicating that items within that status may become unfulfillable.  This new item status property can be applied to any status that may result in unfulfillable holds, such as “Missing” or “Lost.” The hopeless prone property is set to “false” by default.  It can be modified in the Item Statuses interface.  Like all item statuses, this is globally applied without regard to Organizational Unit.  

Please note that existing hold statuses (e.g., Waiting for Item) continue to work as expected, and no additional hold statuses were created as part of the development of this feature.

image::media/hopeless_prone_item_status.png[Item status configuration screen]  

==== Applying the Hopeless Prone Item Status Property ====

. Go to *Administration -> Server Administration -> Item Statuses*
. Double-click the item status you want to edit
. Check the checkbox for *Prone to Hopeless Holds?* to apply the property
. Select *Save* to save your changes.

[[hopeless_holds_interface]]
=== Hopeless Holds Interface ===

The Hopeless Holds interface is used to retrieve a list of unfulfillable holds and perform actions on them.  It is accessible through *Administration -> Local Administration -> Hopeless Holds* to staff with permissions to view and modify holds.

The interface displays a grid similar to that of Holds Requests, with a list of holds that are considered unfulfillable.  Requests are added to this list based on whether there is a value in the Hopeless Date field, which is stored in the `action.hold_request` table.  

image::media/hopeless_holds_interface.png[Hopeless Holds page in Local Administration]

The hold targeter sets (or unsets) the hopeless date value for every hold request based on whether any eligible copies are found to potentially fill the hold.  The first date the hold targeter finds the request unfulfillable is entered in the Hopeless Date field and remains there until unset.  Choosing the action “Find Another Target” will reset the Hopeless Date field in addition to its usual function of triggering the hold targeter.

The list of hold requests can be filtered by hopeless date range and/or pickup library.  Pickup library defaults to the workstation library and retrieves results for the selected library and its descendents.  

All columns in the grid can be sorted by clicking the column header.  The following columns are visible by default:
  
* Hold ID
* Patron Barcode
* Request Date
* Hold Type
* Pickup Library
* Title
* Holdable Formats
* Hopeless Date
* Status
* Part Label

Additional columns are available through the column picker, including the standard column options associated with Holds.

After selecting one or more hold requests from the list, staff can use the Actions menu to perform a variety of tasks.  All actions activate new tabs for each selected record.  Available actions are similar to those found in other holds-related menus (e.g., Cancel Hold, Modify Hold(s), Find Another Target.)  

Additional actions include:

* *Add Holdings* - opens the selected bibliographic records in the Holdings Editor for the purposes of adding new items to the records; this action is disabled if there are metarecord holds among the selected requests
* *Show in Catalog* - opens the selected bibliographic records in OPAC view
* *View/Place Orders* - opens the selected bibliographic records in Acquisitions, where staff can add the titles to a selection list, add the titles to an existing purchase order, or create a new purchase order; this action is disabled if there are metarecord holds among the selected requests

image::media/hopeless_holds_actions.png[Actions menu in Hopeless Holds interface]

TIP: If you use a popup blocker on your browser, it must be configured to allow multiple popups.  If a user selects multiple rows and chooses an action like “Retrieve Patron,” each one appears in a new tab.

== Alternate Hold Pick up Location ==

*Abstract*

This feature enables libraries to configure an alternate hold pick up
location.  The alternate pick up location will appear in the staff
client to inform library staff that a patron has a hold waiting at that
location.  In the stock Evergreen code, the default alternate location
is called "Behind Desk".

*Configuration*

The alternate pick up location is disabled in Evergreen by default.  It
can be enabled by setting *Holds: Behind Desk Pickup Supported* to
'True' in the Library Settings Editor.

Libraries can also choose to give patrons the ability to opt-in to pick up holds at the alternate location through their OPAC account.  To add this option, set the *OPAC/Patron Visible* field in the User Setting Type *Hold is behind Circ Desk* to 'True'.  The User Setting Types can be found under *Administration -> Server Administration ->  User Setting Types*.

*Display*

When enabled, the alternate pick up location will be displayed under the
Holds button in the patron account.

image::media/custom_hold_pickup_location1.png[Custom Hold Pickup Location]


If configured, patrons will see the option to opt-in to the alternate location in the _Account Preferences_ section of their OPAC Account.

image::media/custom_hold_pickup_location2.jpg[OPAC Account]


== Display Hold Types on Pull Lists ==

This feature ensures that the hold type can be displayed on all hold interfaces.

You will find the following changes to the hold type indicator:

. The hold type indicator will display by default on all XUL-based hold
interfaces. XUL-based hold interfaces are those that number the items on the
interface.  This can be overridden by saving column configurations that remove
the _Type_ column.
. The hold type indicator will display by default on the HTML-based pull list.
To access, click _Circulation_ -> _Pull List for Hold Requests_ -> _Print Full
Pull List (Alternate Strategy)_.
. The hold type indicator can be added to the Simplified Pull List.  To access,
click _Circulation_ -> _Pull List for Hold Requests_ -> _Simplified Pull List
Interface_.

To add the hold type indicator to the simplified pull list, click _Simplified
Pull List Interface_, and right click on any of the column headers.  The Column
Picker appears in a pop up window.  Click the box adjacent to _Hold Type_, and
Click _Save_. The _Simplified Pull List Interface_ will now include the hold
type each time that you log into the staff client.

image::media/Display_Hold_Types_on_Pull_Lists1.jpg[Display_Hold_Types_on_Pull_Lists1]

[[hold_groups]]
== Hold Groups

indexterm:[Hold Groups,User Buckets,Hold Subscriptions]

The Hold Groups feature allows library staff to create lists of
patrons that can then be used to place multiple title-level holds on the
same bibliographic record. This is useful for book clubs, new or
on-order items, and/or high demand items.

The Hold Groups interface is based on the xref:circulation:circulation_patron_records_web_client.adoc#_user_buckets[User Buckets]
feature, where staff can create lists of patrons and perform batch
actions for each user on the list.

=== Notable Features of Hold Groups

Patrons can be added to a Hold Group by patron barcode, by an integrated
patron search in the Hold Group interface, and through the normal patron
search.

Hold placement can be randomized so that when a hold is placed it does
not always follow the order in which patrons were added to the Hold
Group, thereby ensuring a fairly distributed holds queue placement for
members of the Hold Group.

Hold Groups for an individual patron are visible on that patron’s record
under *Other -> Hold Groups*.

Hold Groups can be made visible to the patron through the public
catalog. From *My Account*, patrons can view their current hold Hold
Groups and remove themselves from a Hold Group if desired.

Like User Buckets, hold Hold Groups are visible only to the staff member
who created them but can be shared through Bucket ID.

Please see xref:admin:hold_groups_admin.adoc[Hold Groups Administration] for information on some of the technical
developments related to this feature.

Please see xref:opac:my_account.adoc#hold_groups_opac[Hold Groups OPAC] for information on using Hold Groups from the OPAC My Account interface.

=== Hold Groups Staff Interface 

The new Hold Groups interface is found under *Circulation -> Hold
Groups*.

The interface is divided into four tabs:

* *Hold Groups* - The *Hold Groups* tab provides an overview of all Hold
Groups created by the logged in user. New Hold Groups can be created
from this tab.

* *Current Users* - The *Current Users* tab is used to view the list of
users on the open Hold Group. Hold Groups can also be created, edited,
and deleted from this tab. Access to shared Hold Groups can be found on
this tab as well.

* *Add Users* - The *Add Users* tab is used to identify patrons to add to
the open Hold Group.

* *Hold Events* - The *Hold Events* tab displays a list of holds placed
for users in the open Hold Group. Holds can be initiated and canceled
from this tab as well.

As with other interfaces in Evergreen, the tabs for Current Users, Add
Users, and Holds Events include checkboxes for each line (users, holds,
etc.), which are used to activate the Actions menu. The Actions menu is
different on each tab and allows for actions appropriate to the purpose
of the section.

Double-clicking on a Hold Group will open the Hold Group in the *Current
Users* tab.

=== Staff Workflows

The following workflows detail how to create new Hold Groups, add users
to a Hold Group, edit and delete a Hold Group, and place holds for a
Hold Group.

==== Create a New Hold Group

. Go to *Circulation -> Hold Groups*.
. On the Hold Group tab, click *New Hold Group*.
. Enter a name for the Hold Group.
. Enter a description for the Hold Group (optional).
. Choose the owning library from the drop-down (defaults to the
workstation library).
. If you want the Hold Group to be visible to the patrons on the list,
check the *Visible to Patrons?* checkbox.
. Click *Create Bucket*.


The same workflow may be used on the *Current Users* and *Add Users*
tabs to create a new Hold Group.

==== Add Users to a Hold Group

Patrons can be added to a Hold Group by barcode, by searching for a
patron with an integrated patron search on the Add Users tab, or by a
normal patron search. Staff must have PLACE_HOLD permissions to add
patrons to a Hold Group at least at the same organizational unit depth
(library) as the patron they are trying to add. For example, a staff
member with branch level permissions for Branch A could only add patrons
to Hold Groups owned by Branch A. If they needed to add patrons to
Branch B or Branch C too, they would need system or consortial-level
permissions.

===== Add Users By Barcode

. Go to *Circulation -> Hold Groups*.
. Double-click the name of the Hold Group you wish to add patrons to.
. Go to the *Add Users* tab.
. Scan or enter the patron barcode into the *Scan Barcode* field.
. Added patrons appear in a list under the *Add All To Hold Group* button.
Users in this list are considered pending and have not yet been added to
the Hold Group. Note that the parenthetical number for *Add Users*
increases to display the number of pending users.
. Continue adding barcodes as needed.
. From the list, select one or more users with the checkboxes at the
beginning of each row or select all users with the checkbox at the list.
. Use the *Actions* button (or right click any user line) and choose *Add
to Hold Group*. The users will now appear on the *Current Users* tab as
part of the Hold Group.

===== Add Users With Integrated Patron Search 

. Go to *Circulation -> Hold Groups*.
. Double-click the name of the Hold Group you wish to add patrons to.
. Go to the *Add Users* tab.
. Click *Search for Patron*. A patron search pop-up opens. The search is
scoped to the workstation of the logged in staff member, but can be
expanded by using the additional search fields.
. Enter search criteria into the appropriate fields. The pop-up defaults
to the basic patron search. Additional search fields are available by
clicking the down-arrow button to the right of the Search button. This
option is sticky.
. Click *Search* or hit the *Enter* key. Results appear in the bottom
portion of the pop-up window.
. Click anywhere on a row in the results list to select that patron.
. Click *Select*. The patron is added to the list of pending users. Users
on this list have not yet been added to the Hold Group. Note that the
parenthetical number for Add Users increases to display the number of
pending users.
. Continue adding patrons as needed.
. From the list, select one or more users with the checkboxes at the
beginning of each row or select all users with the checkbox at the list.
. Use the Actions button (or right click any user line) and choose *Add to
Hold Group*. The users will now appear on the *Current Users* tab as
part of the Hold Group.
. You can add some or all of the users in the pending users list to
different Hold Groups without entering barcodes or searching again.
Simply go to the *Hold Groups* tab and double-click another Hold Group
from the list. Return to the *Add Users* tab and select the users you
wish to add to the new Hold Group, and use the Actions menu to add them
to the Hold Group.

===== Add Users From Patron Search

. Go to *Search -> Search for Patrons*.
. Enter your search criteria.
. Use the checkboxes on each patron search result to select one or more
patrons.
. Click *Add to Bucket*.
. A list of Hold Groups, as well as other patron buckets, are visible.
(Only those Hold Groups created by the logged in user are visible.)
Choose the Hold Group to which you want to add the patron(s) or create a
new Hold Group.
. A message displays on the bottom right corner of the screen to confirm
whether the patrons were added successfully to the Hold Group.

==== Edit An Existing Hold Group

. Go to *Circulation -> Hold Groups*.
. On the Hold Groups tab, double-click the Hold Group you wish to modify.
This will open the Hold Group in the Current Users tab.
. Click the Hold Groups button and choose Edit Hold Group.

owning library, or visibility.

. Please note that most additional hold options (e.g., choosing the pickup
library or notification preferences) are disabled for holds placed by
Hold Group. Pickup location and notification preferences adhere to the
defaults for the respective patrons. Patrons can edit their notification
preferences and pickup locations from My Account on the public catalog
after the hold is placed. Holds may be suspended and an activate date
added if desired.
. Click Submit.

Holds can be cancelled from the Hold Events tab by selecting the hold
and using the Actions menu and choosing *Cancel Hold Group Event.*

Hold Groups can be deleted on the Current Users tab. Deleting a Hold
Group does not cancel any holds placed through the Hold Group.
