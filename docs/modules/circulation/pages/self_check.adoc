== Introduction ==

Evergreen includes a self check interface designed for libraries that simply
want to record item circulation without worrying about security mechanisms like
magnetic strips or RFID tags.

== Initializing the self check ==
The self check interface runs in a web browser. Before patrons can use the self
check station, a staff member must initialize the interface by logging in.

. Open your self check interface page in a web browser. By default, the URL is
  `https://[hostname]/eg/circ/selfcheck/main`, where _[hostname]_
  represents the host name of your Evergreen web server.
. Log in with a staff account with circulation permissions.

[NOTE]
==========
If the patron forgets to logout the system will automatically log out after the time
period specified in the library setting *Patron Login Timeout (in seconds)*.  An inactivity pop-up
will appear to warn patrons 20 seconds before logging out.
