.Tips for searching 
[TIP] 
=================== 
* Search one field or combine fields for more precise results.  
* Truncate search terms for more search results.
* Search ignores punctuation such as diacritics, apostrophes, hyphens and commas.
* Searching by Date of Birth: Year searches are "contains" searches. E.g. year
  "15" matches 2015, 1915, 1599, etc. For exact matches use the full 4-digit
  year. Day and month values are exact matches. E.g. month "1" (or "01") matches
  January, "12" matches December.
===================

Once you have located the desired patron, click on the entry row for this patron in
the results screen.  A summary for this patron will display on the left hand side.  

image::media/circulation_patron_records-2_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 2]

The _Patron Search_ button on the upper right may be used to resume searching for patrons.

== Retrieve Recent Patrons ==

indexterm:[patrons, retrieving recent]

=== Setting up Retrieve Recent Patrons ===

* This feature must be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor_). The
library setting is called "Number of Retrievable Recent Patrons" and is located
in the Circulation settings group.
** A value of zero (0) means no recent patrons can be retrieved.
** A value greater than 1 means staff will be able to retrieve multiple recent
patrons via a new _Circulation -> Retrieve Recent Patrons_ menu entry.
** The default value is 1 for backwards compatibility. (The _Circulation ->
Retrieve Last Patron_ menu entry will be available.)

=== Retrieving Recent Patrons ===
* Once the library setting has been configured to a number greater than 1, the
option Retrieve Recent Patrons will appear below the Retrieve Last patron
option in the Circulation drop-down from the Menu Bar (_Circulation ->
Retrieve Recent Patrons_).

* When selected, a grid will appear listing patrons accessed by that workstation
in the current session. The length of the list will be limited by the value
configured in the _Library Settings Editor_. If no patrons have been accessed,
the grid will display "No Items To Display."


== Registering New Patrons == 

indexterm:[patrons, registering]

To register a new patron, select _Circulation -> Register Patron_ from the menu bar. The Patron
Registration form will display. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-4.JPG[Patron registration form]

Mandatory fields display in yellow.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-5.JPG[circulation_patron_records 5]

The _Show: Required Fields_ and _Show: Suggested Fields_ links may be used to limit
the options on this page.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-6.JPG[circulation_patron_records 6]

When finished entering the necessary information, select _Save_ to save the new
patron record or _Save & Clone_ to register a patron with the same address.
When _Save & Clone_ is selected, the address information is copied into the
resulting patron registration screen.  It is linked to the original patron.
Address information may only be edited through the original record.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-8.JPG[circulation_patron_records 8]

[TIP]
============================================================================
* Requested fields may be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor_).
* Statistical categories may be created for information tracked by your library 
that is not in the default patron record.
* These may be configured in the _Statistical Categories Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Statistical Categories Editor_).
* Staff accounts may also function as patron accounts.
* You must select a _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ before the _Update Expire
Date_ button will work, since the permission group determines the expiration date.
============================================================================

=== Email field ===

indexterm:[patrons,email addresses]
indexterm:[email]

It's possible for administrators to set up the email field to allow or disallow
multiple email addresses for a single patron (usually separated by a comma).
If you'd like to make changes to whether multiple email addresses
are allowed here or not, ask your system administrator to change the
`ui.patron.edit.au.email.regex` library setting.


== Patron Self-Registration ==
*Abstract*

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.  

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

. Patrons will see a confirmation message: “Registration successful!  Please see library staff to complete your registration.”

image::media/patron_self_registration2.jpg[Patron Self-Registration form]

*Managing Pending Patrons*

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Select the patron you would like to review.  In this screen you have the option to *Load* the pending patron information to create a permanent library account.

. To create a permanent library account for the patron, click on the patron’s row, click on the *Load Patron* button at the top of the screen.  This will load the patron self-registration information into the main *Patron Registration* form. 

. Fill in the necessary patron information for your library, and click *Save* to create the permanent patron account.


[[updating_patron_information]] 
== Updating Patron Information ==

indexterm:[patrons, updating]

Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>.

[[update_hold_notifications]]
=== Update Hold Notifications ===

indexterm:[patrons, holds, notifications]

The public catalog and staff client have the ability to update existing holds if a patron or a staff member changes certain notification preferences or contact information.  Evergreen will detect these changes and prompt the staff user or patron user and ask if they want to update existing holds with the new contact information and/or notification preferences.

NOTE: Email notices are sent at the time of hold capture, the system will not prompt a user when a change to the email address is made - the user will only be prompted if email notifications are turned off or turned on, or if an email address is invalidated by a staff user.

[[update_hold_notifications_staffclient]]
==== Staff Client ====

In the web staff client, the staff user should retrieve a patron and select the *Edit* tab.

If the staff user makes any changes to the any of the following fields, when the staff user clicks *Save*, Evergreen will check if the patron has current unfulfilled holds.

* Daytime Phone
* Evening Phone
* Other Phone
* Default Phone Number
* Default Hold Pickup Location
* any of the Holds Notices checkboxes 

If unfulfilled holds are detected, the staff user will be prompted via a modal to update these holds with the new or updated contact information, or to remove contact information from the holds.

Select the desired holds to update by checking the box next to each different notification grouping and clicking *Update Holds*. The selected holds will be updated. If the user does not wish to update holds, click *Do Not Update Holds*.

image::media/update_holds.png[Update Hold Notifications]

The Update Holds process will also be triggered if a phone number or email address is invalidated. Once the staff user clicks *Save* after invalidating a phone number or email address, Evergreen will check for unfulfilled holds and prompt for removing a notification method if necessary.

As part of this work, certain form validation constraints were added to the web client Patron Editor interface. These include the following:

* If the staff user sets the Holds Notices checkbox to true for Email Notify, Evergreen will enforce entry of a patron Email Address, if Email Address is blank.
* If the staff user sets the Holds Notices checkbox to true for Phone Notify, Evergreen * will enforce entry of a Default Phone Number, if Default Phone Number is blank.
* If the staff user sets the Holds Notices checkbox to true for SMS Notify, Evergreen will enforce entry of a Default SMS/Text Number, if the Default SMS/Text Number field is blank. * Additionally, even if the Holds Notices checkbox is false, if a staff user enters a number in the Default SMS/Text Number field, Evergreen will enforce a selection from the Default SMS Carrier dropdown.

[[update_hold_notifications_opac]]
==== Public Catalog ====

From the Public Catalog MyAccount interface, the patron user should navigate to the _Account Preferences_ tab and then to the _Notification Preferences_ tab. 

If the patron user makes any changes to any of the notification fields, when the patron user clicks *Save* Evergreen will check if the patron has current unfulfilled holds. 

If unfulfilled holds are detected, the patron user will be prompted via an interstitial page to update these holds with the new or updated contact information.

Select the desired holds to update by checking the box next to the each notification grouping and click *Update*. The selected holds will be updated. If the user does not wish to update holds, click *Continue without updating*.

image::media/opac_update_holds.png[Update Hold Notifications in the public catalog]

This work also added a _Notify Method_ column to the _Current Items on Hold_ table, found under the _Holds_ tab, that will show the patron user which notification methods are active, along with which numbers will be used for Phone or SMS notification. 

image::media/notify_methods.png[Show notification methods in the public catalog]

Additionally, patron users can now edit hold notification preferences on individual holds by using the _Edit_ function found in the _Current Items on Hold_ table.

image::media/update_individual_hold.png[Update individual hold in the public catalog]
== Renewing Library Cards ==

edit mode as described in the section <<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Select the _See All_ button next to the _Replace Barcode_ button.  This will
display the current and past barcodes associated with this account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records_14.JPG[circulation_patron_records 14]

Check the box(es) for all barcodes that should be ``active'' for the patron.  An
``active'' barcode may be used for circulation transactions.  A patron may have
more than one ``active'' barcode.  Only one barcode may be designated
``primary.'' The ``primary'' barcode displays in the patron’s summary
information in the _Library Card_ field. 

Once you have modified the patron barcode(s), _Save_ the patron record.  If you
modified the ``primary'' barcode, the new primary barcode will display in the
patron summary screen. 

== Resetting Patron's Password ==

indexterm:[patrons, passwords]

A patron’s password may be reset from the OPAC or through the staff client.  To
reset the password from the staff client, retrieve the patron record as

NOTE: Barring a patron from one library bars that patron from all consortium
member libraries. 

To unbar a patron, uncheck the Barred checkbox.


== Barred vs. Blocked ==

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

*Barred*: Stops patrons from using their library cards; alerts the staff that
the patron is banned/barred from the library. The ``check-out'' functionality is
disabled for barred patrons (NO option to override – the checkout window is
unusable and the bar must be removed from the account before the patron is able
to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds fine threshold 
* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.


== Staff-Generated Messages ==

[[staff_generated_messages]]
indexterm:[patrons, messages]

There are several types of messages available for staff to leave notes on patron records.

*Patron Notes*: These notes are added via _Other_ -> _Notes_ in the patron record. These notes can be viewable by staff only or shared with the patron. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> for more.)

*Patron Alerts*: This type of alert is added via _Edit_ button in the patron record. There is currently no way to require staff initials for this type of alert. (See the section <<circulation_patron_alerts,Patron Alerts>> for more.)

*Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages*: These messages are added via the _Messages_ button in the patron record. They can be a note, alert or block. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<staff_generated_penalties_web_client,Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages>> for more.)

== Patron Alerts ==

[[circulation_patron_alerts]]
indexterm:[patrons, Alerts]
    
When an account has an alert on it, a Stop sign is displayed when the record is
retrieved.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-18_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 18]

Navigating to an area of the patron record using the navigation buttons at the
top of the record (for example, Edit or Bills) will clear the message from view.

If you wish to view these alerts after they are cleared from view, they may be
retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-19_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 19]

There are two types of Patron Alerts:

*System-generated alerts*: Once the cause is resolved (e.g. patron's account has
been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Enter the alert text in the Alert Message field.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-20.png[circulation_patron_records 20]

_Save_ the record. The screen will refresh and the alert will display.

To remove the alert, retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Delete the alert text in the _Alert Message_ field. 

_Save_ the record.  

The screen will refresh and the indicators for the alert will be removed from 
the account. 

== Patron Notes ==

[[circulation_patron_notes]]
indexterm:[patrons, Notes]

Notes are strictly communicative and may be made visible to the patron via their
account on the OPAC.  In the OPAC, these notes display on the account summary
screen in the OPAC.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-23_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 23]

To insert or remove a note, retrieve the patron record as described in the
section  <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>.

=== Add a Message ===

Click *Apply Penalty/Message* to begin the process of adding a message to the patron.

image::media/staff-penalties-2_web_client.png[Apply Penalty Dialog Box]

There are three options: Notes, Alerts, Blocks

* *Note*: This will create a non-blocking, non-alerting note visible to staff. Staff can view the message by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record.  (Notes created in this fashion will not display via _Other_ -> _Notes_, and cannot be shared with the patron. See the <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> section for notes which can be shared with the patron.)

* *Alert*: This will create a non-blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved.  The alert will cause the patron name to display in red, rather than black, text. Alerts may be viewed by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record or by selecting _Other_ -> _Display Alerts and Messages_.

* *Block*: This will create a blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved, and which behaves much as the non-blocking alert described previously. The patron will be also blocked from circulation, holds and renewals until the block is cleared by staff.

After selecting the type of message to create, enter the message body into the box. If Staff Initials are required, they must be entered into the _Initials_ box before the message can be added.  Otherwise, fill in the optional _Initials_ box and click *OK*

The message should now be visible in the _Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages_ list. If a blocking or non-blocking alert, the message will also display immediately when the patron record is retrieved.
