== Creating a Booking Reservation ==

indexterm:[scheduling,resources using the booking module]
indexterm:[booking,reserving a resource]
indexterm:[booking,creating a reservation]
indexterm:[reserving a bookable resource]

[NOTE]
The "Create a booking reservation" screen uses your library's timezone.  If you create a reservation at a library
in a different timezone, Evergreen will alert you and provide the time in both your timezone and the other library's
timezone.

Only staff members may create reservations. A reservation can be started from a patron record, or a booking resource.
To reserve cataloged items, you may start from searching the catalog, if you do not know the booking item's barcode.

=== To create a reservation from a patron record ===

. Retrieve the patron's record.
. Select Other -> Booking -> Create Reservations. This takes you to the Create Reservations Screen.
. If you want to create a reservation that lasts less than a day (such as for a study room), select _Single-day reservation_
as the reservation type.  If your reservation will last several days (such as for a video camera needed for a class project),
select _Multiple-day reservation_.
. In the area labeled "Reservation details", select the _Choose resource by barcode_ tab if you know the specific barcode
of a resource you'd like to reserve.  Otherwise, select the _Choose resource by type_ tab.
. A schedule grid  will display on the bottom part of the screen.
. If necessary, adjust the day or days that are displayed.  You can also make other adjustments using the _Schedule settings_
tab.
. For non-cataloged resources, patrons may wish to specify certain attributes.  The _Attributes_ tab allows you to do this.
For example, if a patron is booking a laptop, they can choose between PC and Mac laptops if they need to.
. When you have found the days or times that work the best, you can proceed with creating the reservation, by doing one
of the following:
** Double click the appropriate row in the grid.
** Use the tab and space keys to select the appropriate rows,
then press Shift+F10 to open the actions menu.  Select
"Create Reservation".
** Select the appropriate rows in the grid, then right click
to open the actions menu. Select "Create Reservation".
** Select the appropriate rows in the grid, then select the
actions button. Select "Create Reservation".
. Adjust the values in this screen as necessary.
. Select the "Confirm reservation" button.
. The screen will refresh, and the new reservation will appear in the schedule.


=== Search the catalog to create a reservation ===

If you would like to reserve a cataloged item but do not know the item barcode, you may start with a catalog search.

. Select Cataloguing -> Search the Catalog to search for the item you wish to reserve. You may search by any
bibliographic information.
. Select the _Holdings View_ tab.
. Right-click on the row that you want to reserve. Select _Book Item Now_. This takes you to the Create Reservations Screen.
. If you want to create a reservation that lasts less than a day (such as for a study room), select _Single-day reservation_
as the reservation type.  If your reservation will last several days (such as for a video camera needed for a class project),
select _Multiple-day reservation_.
. A schedule grid  will display on the bottom part of the screen.
. If necessary, adjust the day or days that are displayed.  You can also make other adjustments using the _Schedule settings_
tab.
. When you have found the days or times that work the best, you can proceed with creating the reservation, by doing one
of the following:
.* Double click the appropriate row in the grid.

== Reservation Pull List ==

indexterm:[pull list,booking]

Reservation pull list can be generated dynamically on the Staff Client.

. To create a pull list, select Booking -> Pull List.

. You can decide how many days in advance you would like to pull reserved items. Enter the number of days in the box
adjacent to Generate list for this many days hence. For example, if you would like to pull items that are needed today,
you can enter 1 in the box, and you will retrieve items that need to be pulled today.

. The pull list will appear. Select the actions button, then _Print_ to print the pull list.

== Capturing Items for Reservations ==

indexterm:[booking,capturing reservations]

Depending on your library's workflow, reservations may need to be captured before they are ready to be picked up by the patron.

[CAUTION]
Always capture reservations in Booking Module. Check In function in Circulation does not function the same as Capture Resources.
