== Circulation vs. Grocery Bills ==

There are two types of bills in Evergreen: *Circulation* bills and *Grocery* bills.

* Circulation bills are system-generated charges such as overdue fines, lost item costs, and 
processing fees. The fine rates, replacement costs, and processing fees can be customized per organizational unit.

* Grocery bills are manually created by staff. Grocery bill types can be shared by 
all libraries or created by an individual library. Default 
price can be attached to each bill type.

== Making Payments ==

Bills can be paid by cash, check, or credit, or be resolved by forgiveness, work, or goods.

. Click on *Bills* tab.
. Select or de-select bills to pay. Oldest bills are paid first by default.
. Select *Receipt On Payment* and enter *#Copies* as required.
. Select the payment type from the drop down menu.
. Enter the payment in the *Payment Received* field and click *Apply Payment*.
. Details of the transaction are displayed.

A credit can be kept in a patron account and used later to pay bills.

. To create or add a credit, select the payment method and enter the amount in *Payment Received*
. Select *Convert Change to Patron Credit* on bottom right.
. Click *Apply Payment.*

To use patron credit to pay bills, select *Patron Credit* as the payment type.

If your library does not use patron credit, you can turn it off through a library setting: "Disable Patron
Credit".
