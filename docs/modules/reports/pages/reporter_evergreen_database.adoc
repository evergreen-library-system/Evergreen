When you use Evergreen, you are creating and updating records within the 
Evergreen database. Evergreen's reporter enables you to create reports to 
extract those records from the database. Understanding some basics about the 
Evergreen  database and how records are created and/or updated when tasks are
 performed  on the staff client and public catalog will help you when working
 with the reporter.
 
Various kinds of data are used by Evergreen to enable you to perform routine 
actions in Evergreen such as checking out an item, registering a patron, or 
placing a hold. Data such as patron names, address, patron barcodes, item 
barcodes, shelving locations, statuses, item prices, check out dates, due dates,
 check in dates, and more are saved in the Evergreen database. This data must be
 organized in an efficient and effective way to make sure it can be stored and 
 retrieved easily.
 
Evergreen uses various tables to keep each type of records. You can visualize a
 table as a spreadsheet: a specified number of columns with an unlimited number
 of rows. Each column is called a field in the database terminology, and each 
 row is a record.

There are many tables in Evergreen's database. Each table contains certain type
 of records, and the information you see displayed on any interface in the staff
 client is likely coming from more than one table. For example, in a patron 
 account, you can find the patron's names, address, phone number, barcode, main
 (profile) permission group, etc., all displaying as one record on the *Edit* tab
 of the patron's account. However, in the database, the patron's address, barcode,
 and main (profile) permission group are saved in separate tables. You don't need
 to know which tables the information is being pulled from when editing a patron
 record on the staff client, but you do need to know when creating a report 
 template involving patron information.
 
Since various information about one patron is saved in separate tables, there 
has to be a way to match the information about one patron correctly to make sure
 all the information is about the same patron. Evergreen does this by assigning
 each patron with a unique database ID and recording the database ID in every 
 related table. So by recording the ID of a record in another table, two tables
 are connected. Some database IDs, such as patron and bibliographic, are visible
 in the staff client, others can only be seen within the database.

The connections among many tables are premade by the reporter. You just need to
 follow the link to find the data saved in the related table. Below is a 
 simplified diagram showing the connections among some commonly used tables 
 which can be a guide for you to find various fields in different tables. 

**Simplified Diagram of the Tables and Connections Among Them**

image::reporter_evergreen_database/evergreen-database.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Database diagram showing the tabels with some primary fields. There are a large number of arrows connecting the tables by ID fields. Highly connected tables are at the center of the diagram and less connected tables are twoards the edges. The details of the connections follow. Each connection is only listed once beginning at the more frequently used side. Circulation is connected to Billing and Billable Transactions by Circ ID. Ciculation is also connected to Item by Item ID, to ILS User (Patron) by Patron ID, and Org Unit (library) by Circ Library ID. ILS User is connected to Stat Cat entry User Map, Hold Request, Billable Transactions, Billing, and Circulation by Patron ID. ILS User (Patron) is connected to is connected to Card by Card ID. ILS User (Patron) is connected to Org Unit (Library) by Home Library ID. ILS User is connected to Address by Address ID. Item is connected to Circulation and Hold Request by Item ID. Item is connected to Call Number by Call Number ID. Item is connected to Org Unit (Library) by Circ Library ID. Item is connected to Item Status by Status ID. Item is connected to Shelving Location by Shelving Location ID. Billing is connected to Billable Transactions by Circ ID. Bibliographic Record is connected to Hold Request and Call Number by Bib ID. Stat Cat Entry User Map is connected to Statistical Category."]

[TIP]
=====
Some tables do not link directly with each other. For example, there is not a 
direct link between the ILS User (patron) table and the item table. Instead, 
these tables link to each other via other tables such as the circulation table
 and the hold request table.
=====

The connections between tables are called joins. Evergreen uses a default join
 when creating report templates which is usually what you need for a template. 
 When working with data that can be null (have no value), you may want to use 
 xref:reports:reporter_create_template.adoc#report_nullability[nullability], 
 which allows you to create an inner join on your selected table. 

When you create a template, you are writing a SQL (structured query language) 
query that will run on the Evergreen database.

This can be viewed in the report output by selecting *Debugging Info*.

[[commonly_used_tables]]
== Commonly Used Tables ==

Database tables are associated with 
xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#report_core_source[Sources] 
in the Reporter.

[NOTE]
======
Some tables and fields in the database still use the term _copy_ while the 
preferred term _item_ is used throughout the staff client.
======

=== ILS User Table ===

This table contains patron/user records. Important fields in this table include:

* Patron names (primary and preferred)
* Phone numbers
* Email address
* Home Library
* Privilege Expiration Date
* Record Creation Date/Time

To find more information about patrons, follow the links to the _Current 
Library Card_ table for patron's current barcode, the _Circulation_ table to f
ind the circulation history, and the _Mailing Address_, _Physical Address_, and
 _Main Profile Group_, etc.

=== Item Table ===

This table contains item records. Important fields in this table include:

* Barcode (item)
* Creation Date/Time
* Active Date/Time 
* Copy Status Changed Time
* Last Edit Date/Time
* Price

Pre-catalogd item information including Dummy ISBN, Precat Dummy Title, and 
Precat Dummy Author is also in this table. When a pre-catalogd item is checked
 out, an item record is created. If the barcode is already in the table and the
 item is not marked deleted, the item record will be updated with the new 
 title, author, etc.

To find more information about items, follow the links to the _Circulation 
Modifier_ table, the _Copy Status_ table, and the _shelving location_ table.

For circulation information follow the link to the _Circulations_ table.

For basic bibliographic information, follow the link to the _Call Number/Volume_
 table. From here, go to the _Bib Record_ table and then select _Simple Records
 Extracts_. Title, Author, ISBN, ISSN, Publisher, Publication Year, and Record 
 ID can be found in this table.

=== Bibliographic Record Table ===

This table contains title information. In most cases you will want the basic 
bibliographic information, which is found within the _Simple Record Extract_ 
table. When linking from other tables you usually have to link through the _Call
 Number/Volume_ table to find the _Bib Record_ table.


=== Circulation Table ===

This table contains circulation records, including pre-catalogd item circulations.

[NOTE]
======
When an item is checked out, a circulation record is created. When an item is 
renewed, the existing circulation record is closed and another circulation record is created.
====== 

Important date/time fields in this table include:
 
* Checkout Date/Time - the time when an item is checked out
* Checkin Date/Time - the effective date when the item is treated as checked in
* Checkin Scan Date/Time - the time when the check-in action is taken
* Due Date/Time - For all daily loans the due time is 23:59:59 of the day in the
 local time zone. Hourly loans have a specific time with time zone information.
* Fine Stops Date/Time - the date when the Maximum Fine limit has been reached,
 or the item is returned, marked lost, or claimed returned. After this date, the
 fine generator will not create new overdue fines for this circulation.
* Record Creation Date/Time - the date and time when the circulation record is
 created. For online checkouts, it is the same as Checkout Date/Time. For offline
 checkouts, this date is the offline transaction processing date.
* Transaction Finish Date/Time - the date when the bills linked to this checkout
 have been resolved. For a regular checkout without bills, this field is filled
 with the check in time when the item is returned.
 
For patron information, follow the link to the _Patron_ table.

For item information, follow the link to the _Circulating Item_ table.

=== In-house Use Table ===

This table contains in-house use records for cataloged items. These in-house 
circulations are done via the 
xref:circulation:circulating_items_web_client.adoc#_in_house_use_f6[In-House Use] interface.

For item information, follow the link to the _Item_ table.

=== Non-catalogd Circulation Table ===

This table contains circulations for 
xref:admin:circing_uncataloged_materials.adoc#_non_cataloged_item_settings[non-cataloged items]. 

For Non-catalogd item type information, follow the link to the _Non-cat Item 
Type_ table.

=== Non-catalogd In-house Use Table ===

This table contains in-house use records for non-cataloged items. 

These in-house circulations are done via the 
xref:circulation:circulating_items_web_client.adoc#_in_house_use_f6[In-House Use] interface.

For Non-catalogd item type information, follow the link to the _Item Type_ table.

=== Hold Request Table ===

This table contains hold records for holds that are waiting to be filled or 
waiting to be picked up.

For patron information, follow the link to the _Hold User_ table.

For information on who placed the hold, follow the link to the _Requesting 
User_ table. The requesting user will either be the patron or a staff member if they placed the hold for the patron.

For information on the items that can be used to fill a hold, follow the link
 to the _Hold Copy Map_. Outside of the reporter, this is referred to as the 
 Eligible Copies table.

[TIP]
======
Target Object ID is shown as a link, but there is no linked table in the Source 
pane. Depending on the type of hold the value in this field could be a bibliographic
 record ID, a call number record ID or an item record ID. This is one of the rare
 cases where you would select a link field to use for your display field.
======

Important date/time fields in this table include:

* Activation Date - the date on which a suspended hold will be activated
* Capture Date/Time - the time when the hold is captured for the hold shelf or 
sent into transit
* Fulfillment Date/Time - the time when the on hold item is checked out
* Hopeless Date - the date a hold became “hopeless,” or unfillable, due to all 
available copies becoming unavailable
* Hold Cancel Date/Time - the time when the hold is canceled
* Hold Expire Date/Time - this could be the date calculated based on your 
library's default Hold Expire Interval or a selected date when placing the hold
* Last Targeting Date/Time - the last time the hold targeting program checked 
for an item to fill the hold. Usually the time will match the Hold Request Time, 
as the hold targeter will generally check every 24 hours. It is usually not 
useful for reporting, but it can serve as an indicator of whether or not the 
request time has been edited.
* Request Date/Time - Usually this is when the hold is placed but it is editable
 on the staff client. So sometimes this may be the request time chosen by the staff.
* Shelf Expire Time - the date based on the Shelf Time and your library's Default 
Hold Shelf Expire Interval
* Shelf Time - the time the item's status is updated to On Hold Shelf

For notification information, follow the link to the _Notifications_ table. This 
table includes Notification Date/Time which indicates when the automatic 
notification was sent.

=== Copy Transit Table ===

This table contains records of item transits. Records are created in this table
 both when an item is sent back to its circulating library as well as when it is
 sent to another library to fill a hold.

For item information, follow the link to the _Transited Copy_ table.
 
=== Hold Transit Table ===

This table contains records of item transits specifically when the item is 
transiting to fill a hold. 

For item information, follow the link to the _Transited Copy_ table.

For hold information, follow the link to the _Hold requiring transit_ table.

=== Billing Line Item Table ===

This table contains all the billing line items such as each day's overdue fines
 and the manually created bills. 

The records in this table are viewable on the Full Details screen on Bills tab 
in a patron's account in the staff client.
 
=== Billable Transaction with Billing Location Table ===

This table contains the summary records of billings and payments. 

Most of the information in these records is displayed on the

xref:circulation:billing.adoc#_bill_history[Bills History] screen. The records
 are updated when either the related billings or payments are updated.

Important fields in this table include:

* Transaction ID - the bill ID and also the circulation record ID for 
circulation bills
* Transaction Start Time - the check out time for circulation-related bills and
 the creation time for manually created bills
* Transaction Finish Time - the time the bill is resolved by being paid, refunded,
 or adjusted to zero
