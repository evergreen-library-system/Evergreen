[TIP]
=====
The documentation that follows focuses primarily on the more robust Advanced 
Reporter. For users that wish to prioritize ease of use over reporting power, 
the xref:reports:simple_reports.adoc#simple_reports_interface[Simple Reports Interface] 
guides a user through a streamlined reports creation wizard and intentionally
 curtails the extensive options available in the main Reports interface. 
=====

It is possible to report on almost every field in every table in the Evergreen
 database using the Advanced Reporter. 

There are three main components used by the reporter:

* report template
* report definition
* report output

These components are saved in xref:reports:reporter_folder.adoc[folders] specific
 to the user account. Users can xref:reports:reporter_folder.adoc#sharing_folders[share their folders]
 to allow others to clone templates and view report definitions and output, but
 only the owning staff account can manage the contents of their folders.

[TIP]
=====
Know which library staff at your library have recurring reports set up and make
 sure to stop those reports when the staff member leaves your library.  

Once a library staff account is closed it is no longer possible to access the 
reporter via the staff client and you will require assistance from your 
Evergreen System Administrator to stop any recurring reports run by the library
 staff account.
=====

Report templates tell Evergreen what fields are to be displayed in the report 
output and what conditions to filter on in the database. These templates allow 
you to run a report more than once, without building it anew every time. 
Templates may be shared for commonly needed reports. These templates can be 
xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates.adoc[cloned] and used as is or 
xref:reports:reporter_modifying_templates.adoc[modified] by library staff. 
Library staff can also xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc[create new report templates]. 
Successfully creating a new template generally requires a solid understanding
 of Evergreen and the xref:reports:reporter_evergreen_database.adoc[Evergreen database]. 

When a xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#running_reports[report is run] Evergreen
 looks at the values defined for the filters in the report definition and then 
 goes through the database and gathers the records that meet the conditions into
 an output file. The output file can be viewed via the reporter within the staff 
 client or via a link in the report completion email. See 
 xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#viewing_report_output[Viewing Report Output]
 for more information.

== Accessing the Reporter ==

The Reports interface is accessed in Evergreen by going to *Administration -> Reports*.

Users without reporter permissions granted to their staff account will see the 
message _You do not have sufficient permissions to run reports_ in the lower 
corner of the screen. The *Change Operator* modal will open with the message 
_Permission denied. Please enter credentials for an account that has the 
RUN_REPORTS,VIEW_REPORT_OUTPUT permission._
