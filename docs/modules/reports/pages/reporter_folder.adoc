indexterm:[reports, report folders, folders]

The folders pane in the reporter is divided into two sections:

* _My Folders_ which contains the folders created with your Evergreen account.
* _Shared Folders_ which contains folders shared with you by other users.

image::reporter_folder/reports_first_login.png["Screenshot of Evergreen Reports page. Two tabs at the top, Browse and Search. Below the tabs 'My Folders' with three link; Templates, Reports, Outputs. Below that is 'Shared Folders' with the same three links. There is a caret next to the shared Templates and Reports."]

There are three main components used by the reporter which each must be stored
 in a separate folder:

* _Templates_ which tell Evergreen what fields to offer as filters and what 
columns to display in the results file.
* _Reports_ which tell Evergreen what values to filter on, how often to run the
 report, and what file formats to output the results in.
* _Outputs_ which is the final results file from Evergreen with the information
 from the database.

To work with templates, reports, and outputs in the reporter you must
 have at least one folder created under each component.

[[creating_folders]]
== Creating Folders ==

indexterm:[creating folders, report folders, reports]

[TIP] 
=====
It is recommended to use a parallel naming scheme for folders in Templates, 
Reports, and Outputs to help keep your reports organized and easier to find, 
i.e., you might create a folder named 'Monthly Statistics' under Templates and 
then make matching 'Monthly Statistics' folders under Reports and Outputs.
=====

To create a folder within _Templates_, _Reports_, or _Outputs_:

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section click on the folder you would like to create a 
subfolder in. You may need to click on the caret(s) to expand the relevant 
folder tree.
+
image::reporter_folder/reports_subfolders.png[Screenshot of the Templates under My Folders. A subfolder labeled Monthly Statistics has been highlighted. To the right is the folder name followed by a number of buttons. Button four is Add Subfolder.]
+
. Select the button *Add Subfolder*.
+
image::reporter_folder/create_template_folder.png["Screenshot of the Create a Template Folder modal. It reads Enter a name for the subfolder of Monthly Statistics. Collections is entered in the folder name field. There are two buttons on the modal, Confirm and Cancel."]
+
. Enter a name for the folder.
. Select the _Confirm_ button.
. The folder can now be seen in the appropriate folder tree.
+

[NOTE]
======
When creating folders at the top level (directly under _Templates_, _Reports_, 
or _Outputs_) Evergreen will only display a button to add a top-level folder.

[[managing_folders]]
== Managing Folders ==

indexterm:[reports folders, managing folders]

[TIP]
=====
Clicking the blue text of a folder name displays the contents of the folder in 
the righthand pane. Clicking the caret in front of a folder name displays its 
subfolders.
=====

Once a folder has been created, you can change the name, delete the folder, 
create a new subfolder, or change the sharing settings. 

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section select the name of the folder that you wish to manage.
. Use the buttons at the top of the righthand pane to perform actions.
+
image::reporter_folder/file_management_buttons.png[Screenshot of the name of a folder with buttons below.]

. You can:
.. Remove filters
.. Create a new template
.. Rename the folder
.. Create a new subfolder (see above)
.. Share or hide the folder (see below)

[[sharing_folders]]
== Sharing Folders ==

indexterm:[sharing reports, reports folders]

_Templates_, _Reports_, and _Outputs_ folders can be private (accessible only to
 the user who created the folder) or shared with other staff at the library or 
 other libraries within your system or consortium who have reporter permissions.
 Templates in a shared folder are searchable using the _Search Templates_ feature
 by anyone with permissions to see that folder.

[[sharing_your_folders]]
=== Sharing Your Folders ===

Folders can be shared at any time after they are created.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section select the name of the folder that you wish to share.
. Select the *Share Folder* button.
. Select the Org Unit for the level at which you would like to share your folder, 
e.g., other staff at your branch, your whole system, anyone in your consortium. 
All users with reports permissions at the selected level will be able to access
 and search for templates in your shared folder.
. Select *Save*.
. The folder will now show under _My Folders_ with the library code of the 
organizational unit it is shared within parentheses. 
+
image::reporter_folder/sharing_a_folder.png[Screenshot of "My Folders" area showing the top level Templates folder and the subfolder named "Monthly Statistics." In parentheses next to the "Monthly Statistics" folder is BR2.]
+
. If you wish to change the sharing scope for the folder, you must first unshare
 the folder and then re-share it with the new share scope. See below for information
 on unsharing folders.

[NOTE]
=========
A subfolder may be shared even if the parent folder is not shared. The shared
 subfolder will act as a floating folder for other users and will attach itself
 under the parent group, e.g., Templates.
=========

[[hiding_your_folders]]
=== Hiding Your Folders ===

indexterm:[hiding report folders, sharing reports, reports]

Folders are hidden (unshared) by default. Folders that have been shared can be
 unshared later.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ pane select the name of the folder that you wish to hide.
. Select the *Unshare Folder* button.
. The folder will now show under _My Folders_ without a library code in parentheses.
 
[[viewing_shared_folders]]
=== Viewing Shared Folders ===

indexterm:[shared report folders, report folders, reports]

Folders that are shared with your org unit display in the _Shared Folders_
section.

image::reporter_folder/shared_folders.png[Screenshot of the Shared Folders tree displaying a folder labeled BCO (CONS) under Templates and Mike (CONS) under Reports.]

The top level of shared folders displays the username of the account that has 
shared the folder.

While it is most common for users to share template folders, reports and outputs
 folders can be shared
as well.

You can only view the contents of the shared folders. To make edits, you must 
xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates.adoc[clone the templates] into 
your own folders.
