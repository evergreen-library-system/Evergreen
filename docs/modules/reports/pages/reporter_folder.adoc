indexterm:[reports, report folders, folders]

The folders pane in the reporter is divided into two sections:

* _My Folders_ which contains the folders created with your Evergreen account.
* _Shared Folders_ which contains folders shared with you by other users.

image::media/report-folders-1.png[Report Folder View]

There are three main components used by the reporter which each much be stored in a separate folder:

* _Templates_ which tell Evergreen what fields to offer as filters and what columns to display in the results file.
* _Reports_ which tell Evergreen what values to filter on, how often to run the report, and what file formats to output the results in.
* _Output_ which is the final results file from Evergreen with the information from the database.

In order to work with templates, reports, and output in the reporter you must have at least one folder created under each component. See the next section on Creating Folders.

A shared subfolder must be created within a shared folder. The shared subfolder must have the same
share scope or a narrower share scope than the parent folder.

Subfolders created within unshared folders or folders that are shared with a wider scope than the parent folder may result in folders not displaying at all.  

Please be cautious when creating shared subfolders.

section.
