== Introduction ==

Once you have created a folder, the next step in building a report is to create 
or clone a template. Templates allow you to run a report more than once without 
building it anew every time, by changing definitions to suit current 
requirements. For example, you can create a shared template that reports on 
circulation at a given library. Then, other libraries can use your template and 
simply select their own library when they run the report.

It may take several tries to refine a report template to give the output that 
you want. It can be useful to plan out your report on paper before getting 
started with the reporting tool. Group together related fields and try to 
identify the key fields that will help you select the correct source.

It may be useful to create complex queries in several steps. For example, first 
add all fields from the table at the highest source level. Run a report and check 
to see that you get results that seem reasonable. Then clone the template, add 
any filters on fields at that level and run another report. Then drill down to 
the next table and add any required fields. Run another report. Add any filters
 at that level. Run another report. Continue until you’ve drilled down to all the 
fields you need and added all the filters. This might seem time consuming, and 
you will end up cloning your initial template several times. However, it will help 
you to check the correctness of your results and will help to debug if you run 
into problems because you will know exactly what changes caused the problem. 
Also consider adding extra fields in the intermediate steps to help you check 
your results for correctness.

== Creating a Template ==

Before creating a completely new template, it is recommended that you check for 
shared templates to see if there is a template that can be modified to give you
 the information you need. The template search can be used to find and identify
 potential templates. Please note that the search does not provide the folder 
 name where the template is stored. Be sure to leave out any special characters
 or punctuation in your search.

See xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates[Cloning Report Templates] 
for more information.

Creating a template can be complex and requires some understanding of the 
Evergreen database and how Evergreen handles various records when performing 
tasks in the staff interface. It can be useful to plan out your template before
 getting started with the reporter. Think about what type of records you will
be reporting on (circulation, item, bibliographic, patron, etc.) and what 
information you want to see displayed in your report output. You also want to 
think about what filters should be used so the report output contains only the
 records you're interested in.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*. 
. In the _My Folders_ section, select the caret beside the _Templates_ folder to
 see your template folders. Use the carets to expand the folder tree until you 
 find the folder where you'd like to create the new template.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/template_folders.png[Screenshot of the expanded templates folder tree under the My Folders section.]
+
. Select the folder name.
. In the folder, select *New Template*.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/new_template_button.png[Screenshot of the five folder action buttons under the folder name. New Template is the second button.]
+
. The _New Template_ editor will open. See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#report_template_editor[Report Template Editor]
 for information on using the editor.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/new_template_interface.png["Screenshot of the New Template page. The page header says New Template. Next are the Fields for Template Name, Documentation URL, and Folder, followed by the Template Description field. Below that are the save and close buttons. Under a dividing line is the Select Source drop-down and a lot of empty space."]
+
. Add a *Template Name*.
. Choose a source using the *Select Source* drop-down menu. See 
xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#report_core_source[Report Source] 
for more details.
. Add *Display Fields*. See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#adding_report_display_field[Adding a Display Field] 
for more details.
. Add *Filters*. See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#adding_report_filters[Adding a Filter] 
for more details.
+
[CAUTION]
=========
All report templates MUST have at least one filter to choose a specific library.
 This filter is important as it allows staff to restrict the data in the report 
 output to only data relevant to their library.
=========
+
. Add hardcoded filter values for any filters that should always use the same value.
 See xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#hardcoded_filters[Reporter Basics] 
 for a list of filters that are commonly hardcoded.
. Make adjustments to the *Report Layout*. See 
xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#template_report_layout[Template Report Layout] 
for more details.
. Select *Save*.
. Your new template can now be found in the folder you saved it to.
. xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#running_reports[Run a report] from the new
 template to see if the desired output is generated.
+
[TIP]
=====
If the path for one of your display fields or filters is incorrect, you will get
 an error instead of the expected report output. Sometimes the error text will 
 give you a clue about what isn't working.

image::reporter_create_templates/output_error.png["Screenshot from the Outputs folder. A line is selected. In the Output column, where you would normally see HTML and CSV button links, it says Error running report. The cursor is hovering over the Error text column to show the full error text. The text begins 'DBD::Pg::st execute failed: ERROR'."]

You can modify your template and try again. 
=====
+
. Repeat the above steps until your template works as desired.

[NOTE]
======
It is not unusual to create multiple versions of a template when working to 
modify a template. Once you have a template that works as desired, it is 
recommended that you delete the interim versions of the template.
See xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#deleting_report_templates[Deleting Report Templates].
======

[[report_template_editor]]
== Report Template Editor ==

The report template editor is made up of three sections:

* Section A: Basic information
* Section B: Display field and filter options and selections.
** B1: *Source*.
** B2: Available fields from selected *Source*.
** B3 Fields selected for inclusion in template and modifying information.
* Section C: *Display Fields*, *Filters*, and *Report Layout* tabs

image::reporter_create_templates/template_editor_sections.png["Annotated screenshot of the New Template Editor screen. Across the top in section A: Template Name, Documentation URL, Folder, Templated Description. Under that, in the left pane, is section B1 which has the Source drop-down. Non-cataloged circulation is the source and below that is a tree showing the connected tables such as Circulating Library. In the main pane we have section C with the three tabs, currently displaying Display Fields. Below is B2, centrally placed on the screen, it is a list of all fields from the Non-cataloged Circulation source. To the right of B2 is B3 which shows a selected field, with relevant transform and an option to provide a hint. The label at the top of this section is Field Display Order."]

=== Basic Information Section ===

The basic information section of the report template editor is where you can add 
or update the *Template Name*, *Template Description*, and *Documentation URL*.

[NOTE]
======
The names of templates in a folder must be unique. Evergreen will not allow a
 template using an identical name to be saved into the same folder.
======

If you have local documentation online that pertains to a report template, you
 can add it in the *Documentation URL* field, and it will be included as a link
 in the report output.

[NOTE]
=====
Best practice for your *Template Description* is to include a brief summary of 
the report purpose, a list of display fields, and a list of filters. 

As you make new iterations of the template you can keep track of your changes 
in the description field. 
=====

[[report_display_fields_and_filters]]
=== Display Field and Filter Selector ===

The *Display Field* and *Filters* selection area is where you build and modify 
the template columns, data filters, and report layout.

[[report_core_source]]
==== Report Source ====

Every report template starts with a *Source*. This is the database table from 
which your template is built. The drop-down menu displays as _Select Source_ when
 a new template is first created. Selecting a *Source* will cause the rest of the
 display field and filter selections area to populate.

image::reporter_create_templates/select_source.png["Screenshot of a new, unfilled, template. The drop-down menu option, Select Source, is highlighted below the basic information area and the Save and Close buttons."]

[CAUTION]
=====
When modifying an existing template, NEVER change the source. This will scrap 
your existing template and you will have to start again from scratch.
=====

When creating a new template, the first thing you need to do is figure out which
 source makes the most sense for the data you want to see in your report output.
 If you need information from other tables, you'll follow the table tree to those 
 tables when adding display fields and filters. *Sources* are divided in the 
 drop-down menu into _Core sources_ and _Other sources_. Most standard statistics
 reports will be created with _Core Sources_ as these represent the primary 
 database tables. The _Other sources_ are less frequently used tables or specially
 created data views. 

The three most commonly used _Core sources_ are _Circulation_, _Item_, and 
_ILS User_. Templates for monthly circulation statistics and templates for 
tracking overdue items use the _Circulation_ source. Templates about the state
 of your collection use the _Item_ source. Templates containing counts or lists
 of your patrons use the _ILS User_ source. More information can be found in 
 xref:reports:reporter_evergreen_database.adoc#commonly_used_tables[Commonly Used Tables].

You can link to other database tables to include information contained in those
 tables but not every table links directly. For example, patrons and items 
 aren't directly linked to each other. Information about items checked out to a
 patron is held in the circulation table while information about items on hold 
 is found in the hold request table. More information can be found in 
 documentation about the 
 xref:reports:reporter_evergreen_database.adoc[Evergreen Database].

[[report_nullability]]
==== Nullability ====

You may wish to use nullability if your report output includes null values that
 you don’t want included. A _NULL_ value in a field means that there is no value
 in that field.

===== Nullability in Action =====

By default, Evergreen will include data that matches your query, even if there 
is a null value for one of your fields. If you do not want the null values to 
display in your results, use the nullability checkbox that can be found on the
 left of each potentially linked source. 

image::reporter_create_templates/nullibility_selected.png["Screenshot of the Source and Source tree area. The Source is Shelving Location with subsections for Copies, Copy Location Orders, and Owning Org Unit. The checkbox to the left of Copies is selected."]

Selecting the nullability checkbox tells the template NOT to include data from
 that joined source if the field on the child, or right-side source, is null. 

The simplified set of outputs below show the same results of a count of items 
by shelving location, with and without using the nullability checkbox. The first
 chart includes a line for DVDs, even though no items have been assigned to that
 shelving location. This would be the default provided by Evergreen. To get the 
 result in the second  chart, we would select the nullability box next to the 
 *Copies* table as we built the report; just like you see in the image above. 

image::reporter_create_templates/nullibility_demo.png["Two charts side-by-side. They are identical except for the titles at the top and an additional row of data at the bottom of the left one. The left chart is titled Evergreen's Default Results. The left column is labeled Shelving Location (parent table) and the right is labeled Item Count (child table). Fiction has 200 items. Non-fiction has 100 items. Reference has 50 items. DVD has NULL. The DVD line is highlighted. The right chart is labeled Results Using Nullability Checkbox. It does not show the DVD line, everything else is the same."]

[NOTE]
======
The default behavior can be a great way of catching possible data issues.
======

===== Details on Nullability in Evergreen ===== 

Nullability allows you to have more control over whether null values in fields
 are included in your report output. Once you have selected a source, you will 
 see a tree on the far left showing the sources which can be linked (joined) to
 the selected source. The type of join determines what data can show up with a 
 null value in your results: inner joins will only show non-null results; outer 
 joins will allow null results. 

The default behavior in Evergreen is now a left outer join; the parent can have
 a null value in the linking field to the child, in which case the parent will 
 contribute a row but all the child fields for that row will be null. If there 
 is a value in the parent's linking field, then rows from the child (but only 
 where the linking field matches!) will come in.

However, if we use the new nullability checkboxes we can create an inner join 
which will tell Evergreen to not include results where either parent or child 
are null.  

To learn more about nullability, see the Evergreen conference presentation
 https://youtu.be/oDtjpW3Kiz8[Thanks for Nothing: Nullability Selection in Evergreen Reports].
 While the _Advanced Reports_ interface has changed since this presentation, 
 the conceptual discussions of nullability are still applicable.

[[report_displayed_fields]]
=== Display Fields ===

Display fields are the columns of information that will display on your report
 output. The *Display Fields* tab is the active tab by default in the _Report
 Template Editor_.

[[adding_report_display_field]]
==== Adding a Display Field ====

Display fields are the columns which will be displayed in your report output.

. Ensure the *Display Fields* tab is the active tab in the *Display Field, 
Filters, and Report Layout* tabs section of the _Report Template Editor_.
. Select the top of the tree in the _Source_ pane. A list of available fields
 will be displayed in the _All Fields_ pane to the right under the *Display Fields* tab.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/all_fields_from_source.png[Screenshot of the Source and All Fields sections. The blue link for item at the top of the source tree is highlighted and an arrow has been added pointing to the right towards the All Fields column header.]
+
. The word in parentheses beside the field name indicates the 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_data_types[data type]. 
If the field you want to use is a link, you need to expand the tree in the 
_Source_ pane to find it and then select it. This will open a new list of 
options under the _All Fields_ heading. In the screenshot below, we have 
selected *Call Number/Volume* in the tree as this was displaying as a 
link when we were at the Item level. The current selection can be confirmed at
 the top next to the *Source* drop-down. Now that we are at the call number 
 level, we can see that there are three different options related to call number.
 To display call numbers in an understandable way we will need to use *Call Number Label*.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/link_in_tree.png["Screenshot of the left side of the screen with three highlighted areas, Call Number/Volume under the Source tree, the big confirmation text of which source we are viewing above the Display Fields tab, and the three call number related fields we could use under All Fields."]
+
. Select the field in the _All Fields_ pane you would like to add as a display field.
+

[NOTE]
=====
For display fields, you generally want to pick a text field over an ID or org
 unit field. For example, to add call number as a display field, you will select
 *Call Number Label* rather than *Call Number/Volume ID*.
=====
+
. In the _Field Display Order_ pane, select the 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[transform]
 you would like to use. The transforms available in the list will vary depending
 on the xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_data_types[data type]
 of the selected field.
.. The transform will determine how Evergreen processes the data when generating
 the report. _Raw Data_ is the most commonly used transform for display fields 
 except when it's a timestamp, in which case _Date_ is more commonly used. More 
 information on the available transforms can be found in 
 xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[Field Transforms].
+
image::reporter_create_templates/transform_display_fields.png["A screenshot of one selected display field. The Name field says Call Number Label. The transform drop-down menu is open. Raw Data is the option selected at the top. The other options are Upper Case, First 5 characters, Lower Case, Substring, First Value, Last Value, Minimum Value, Maximum Value, and Count."]
+

[NOTE]
======
The action *Supply Hint* on the *Display Fields* tab can generally be ignored. 
The column documentation will appear next to the column name in the _Report 
Columns_ section of the template, but it does not appear next to the column
 name in the report output.
======

[[reordering_display_fields]]
==== Reordering Display Fields ====

. You can use the arrows on the right to move fields up and down the list.
The list order top to bottom here on the _Display Fields_ tab will determine the
order of column display from left to right. Sorting is controlled
separately, in the *Report Layout* tab.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/reorder_fields.png["A screenshot of two selected display fields. On the far right, next to the Transform field, there are a pair of arrow buttons. The left-side button points up and the right-side button points down. There is a pair of arrows for each display field."]
+
. Repeat until your fields are in the order you desire.

[[renaming_a_display_field]]
==== Renaming a Display Field ====

You can adjust the display name of any field by clicking in the *Name* box
and typing in a new name. The original field name will show below the
*Name* box along with the path you took to field the field starting at your 
source.

[NOTE]
======
It is best practice to include qualifiers in the field names for fields like
 barcode and library so that staff know what data they are looking at in the 
 report output.

For example, for multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal
 borrowing, it is not uncommon for the _Circulating Library_ and _Owning Library_
 of an item to be different. In this case, it is important to specify in the 
 field name which type of library is being presented in the report output data.
======

[[changing_a_display_transform]]
==== Changing a Transform ====

For information on specific transforms, see 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[Field Transforms].

You can adjust the way data will display in your output by using the
*Transform* dropdown on each selected field. Transform options will vary 
depending on the fields you have selected, and in some cases will default to a
 specific recommended transform value (e.g., fields that total payments will
default to a transform of “Sum”).

image::reporter_create_templates/changing_a_transform.png["Screenshot of two selected fields under the Field Display Order section. The transform field for Copy ID is open to show the following options: Raw Data, First Value, Last Value, Minimum Value, Maximum Value, and Count."]

[[removing_a_display_field]]
==== Removing a Display Field ====

[CAUTION]
=========
Removing display fields usually does not affect the result set for the report
 output, but it can, especially when the report output displays a count of records
 (whether item, patron, circulation, hold, or bibliographic).

When removing fields, be mindful of whether or not it will still be clear in the 
report output what your results mean. 
=========

You can remove a field by clicking the *minus* button on the left of this
area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the options under the
 _All Fields_ header.

image::reporter_create_templates/removing_fields.png["Screenshot of the Display Fields tab contents. On the left is the list of possible fields. One of the fields, Copy ID, is selected and there is a box highlighting the selected checkbox. The right side of the screen shows the information for the Copy ID field. There is a box highlighting the minus button next to the field name."]

[[report_filters]]
=== Filters ===

[[adding_report_filters]]
==== Adding a Filter ====

Filters allow you to set up the criteria so that Evergreen returns the information
 you are looking for. Once the criteria have been added to the template, the 
 value for the filter can be hardcoded in at the template level or entered when 
 the report is run.

. Select the *Filters* tab as the active tab in the *Display Fields*, *Filters*, 
and *Report Layout* tabs section of the _Report Template Editor_.
. As you did when selecting the display fields, select the top of the tree in 
the _Source_ pane. A list of available fields will be displayed under _All Fields_.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/adding_filters.png[Screenshot shows All fields related to Circulation under the All Fields header. The checkbox for Checkin Scan Date/Time is selected and that field is displayed on the right.]
+
.. The word in parentheses beside the field name indicates the 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_data_types[data type].
 If the field you want to use is a link, you need to expand the tree in the 
 _Source_ pane to find it and then select it. This will open a new list of options
 under the _All Fields_ heading. 
. Select the field in the _All Fields_ pane you would like to add as a display field.
+
[NOTE]
=====
For filters you generally want to pick an ID, or Org unit field over a text field. 
For example, to add circulating library as a filter you will select *Circulating 
Library*  which is labeled as an Org unit.
=====
+
. In the _Filter Fields and Values_ area, select the 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[transform] 
you would like to use. The transforms available in the list will vary depending
 on the xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_data_types[data type]
 of the selected field.
.. The transform will determine how Evergreen processes the data when generating
 the report. Raw data is the most commonly used transform for filters except 
 when it's a timestamp in which case _Date_ or _Month + Year_ is more commonly 
 used. More information on the available transforms can be found in 
 xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[Field Transforms].
. Next, select the *Operator*. See 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_operators[Report Operators].
+
image::reporter_create_templates/operator_and_transforms.png["Screenshot of a selected filter, Checkin Scan Date/Time. Highlighted below the field name are the Transform and Operator drop-down menus. The selected transform is Date, and the selected operator is Between."]
+
. If desired, you can hardcode the value of the filter into the template. See 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#hardcoded_filters[Hardcoded Filters] for more
 information.

[[changing_transform]]
==== Changing a Transform ====

For information on specific transforms, see 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[Field Transforms].

. On the *Filters* tab, locate the field for which you would like to change 
the transform.
. Use the *Transform* drop-down on the field to select the 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_field_transforms[transform] 
you would like to use. The transforms available in the list will vary depending on
 the xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_data_types[data type] 
 of the selected field.

image::reporter_create_templates/transform_selection.png[Screenshot of the same selected filter as above. The left drop-down for Transform is highlighted. The selected transform is Date.]

[[changing_an_operator]]
==== Changing an Operator ====

For information on specific operators, see 
xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_operators[Report Operators].

. On the _Filter_ tab, locate the field on which you would like to change the
 operator.
. Use the *Operator* drop-down on the field to select the new operator from the 
list.

image::reporter_create_templates/operator_selection.png[Screenshot of the same selected filter as above. The right drop-down for Operator is highlighted. The selected operator is Between.]

[[updating_filter_value]]
==== Updating a Filter Value ====

Filter values can be hardcoded into a template or left blank to be filled in 
when the report is run. Information on commonly hardcoded filters can be found in 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#hardcoded_filters[Reporter Basics].

Hardcoding a filter is recommended when the value of the filter will not change. 
For example, hardcoded filters are often used when filtering out deleted items.

Filter values can also be hardcoded into templates to make it easier for staff 
with less reporter experience to run certain reports. For example, you can set 
up a report with an _Item Status_ filter with a hardcoded value  of _Missing_
 so that staff can run a report to get a list of all missing items without having
 to enter filter information.

It is recommended that you balance the reusability of templates that comes when
 staff enter filter values at the time of running a report versus the ease of 
 use for staff with less experience with the reporter. For example, when no value
 is entered in the template for a filter on Item Status, staff can pick the 
 relevant status from the list of existing statuses. When a value is hardcoded
 for Item Status, a new template must be created every time you wish to filter
 on a different item status.

. On the *Filter* tab, locate the field you would like to add, update, or remove
 the filter value for.

.. To add a value, 
... Select the *Supply Filter Value* checkbox beneath the field's *Transform* 
field. A new set of options for *Filter value* will be displayed under the *Operator*
 field. The particular filter mechanism will vary depending on your selected 
 *Transform* and *Operator*. See 
 xref:reports:reporter_template_terminology.adoc#report_filter_values[Filter Values]
 for details on exactly how different values must be entered.
... Select or enter your desired value.
.. To edit a preexisting value, overwrite the current *Filter Vale* with your 
desired value. 
.. To remove an existing hardcoded value, deselect the *Supply Filter Value*
 checkbox. Filter values will instead need to be added at the report definition level.

image::reporter_create_templates/filter_value.png["Screenshot of the selected filter field 'Is Deleted'. Below the transform field the Supply Filter Value box is checked. To the right, under the operator field, the filter value is set to False."]

[[removing_filter]]
==== Removing a Filter ====

[CAUTION]
=========
Removing a filter WILL affect what results are included in your report output. 
Ensure you don't need to filter on a particular field before removing it.

It is recommended that reports have at least one filter to choose a specific
 library. This filter is important as it allows staff to restrict the data in
 the report output to only data relevant to their library.
=========

You can remove a field by clicking the *minus* button on the left of this
area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the options under the
 _All Fields_ header.

image::reporter_create_templates/removing_filter_fields.png["Screenshot of the Filters tab contents. On the left is the list of possible fields. One of the fields, Is Deleted, is selected and there is a box highlighting the selected checkbox. The right of the screen shows the information for the Is Deleted field. There is a box highlighting the minus button next to the field name."]


[[changing_column_documentation]]
==== Changing the Column Documentation ====

When running a report, the filter can include text which gives information on 
how to use the particular filter and, in some cases, how to enter the filter value.
 In the _Report Template Editor_, this is referred to as column documentation 
 or a field hint.

. On the *Filter* tab, locate the field you would like to add column 
documentation to.
. Select the *Supply Hint* box. 
. Enter the hint text in the newly displayed field.
+
image::reporter_create_templates/report-filters-3.png[Screenshot of a filter for creation date/time. Under the transform and operator fields are checkboxes for supply filter value and supply hint. Supply hint is checked and the newly exposed hint text field is filled in and highlighted.]
+
. When running a report, the hint will display under the filter path. 
+
image::reporter_create_templates/report-filters-4.png[Screenshot of the same filter but from the report view instead of the template view. The hint is now displayed in the lower right of the filter area.]

[[template_report_layout]]
== Template Report Layout ==

indexterm:[report layout]

Select the *Report Layout* tab to adjust the organization of the data on your 
final output. On the left side, under _Field Display Order_, you can rename 
columns, adjust transforms, and reorder your columns in this tab in the same 
way you can in the *Field Display* tab.

On the right side, under _Field Sort Order_, you can independently set sort 
orders on each column as well as determine which column should sort first, second,
third, etc. The sorting is independent of the column display order.

image::reporter_create_templates/report_layout_tab.png["Screenshot of two columns under the report layout tab. They show different information related to the same list of selected display fields. The left column, Field Display Order, looks the same as the view on the display fields tab. The right side has the field display names greyed out to indicate the names cannot be edited here. To the right of the name field is a direction field that indicates Descending or Ascending behavior. Further to the right is a pair of arrows like on the Display Fields tab. The order of the field in the left column is Organizational Unit, Circulations, Workstation Name. The order on the right column is Circulations, Organizational Unit, and Workstation Name."]

In the example above, the first three columns to display will be _Organizational 
Unit_, _Circulations_, and then _Workstation Name_, but the report will
sort first by _Circulations_, then by _Organizational Unit_, and then by 
_Workstation Name_.

[[troubleshooting_report_templates]]
== Troubleshooting Report Templates ==

indexterm:[troubleshooting, troubleshooting reports]

If the path for one of your display fields or filters is incorrect, when you try
 to run a report you will get an error instead of the expected report output. 
 Sometimes the error text will give you a clue about what isn't working. You can 
 modify your template and try again.
 
 image::reporter_create_templates/output_error["Screenshot from the Outputs folder. A line is selected. In the Output column, where you would normally see HTML and CSV button links, it says Error running report. The cursor is hovering over the Error text column to show the full error text. The text begins 'DBD::Pg::st execute failed: ERROR'."]

If you continue to run into difficulties creating or modifying a template, you
 may need to contact your system administrator for assistance.

Before contacting your system administrator, ensure the applicable template folder
 is xref:reports:reporter_folder.adoc#sharing_folders[shared with your library] 
 so your system administrator is able to view the template in question.
