The basic steps to using Evergreen's reporter are:

. Create a template. 
See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc[Creating Report Templates].
.. Alternatively, find a template and clone it into your folders if it was 
created by another user. 
See xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates.adoc[Cloning Report Templates].
. Run the report, also referred to as creating a report definition.
. View your output either through the staff client or via your email.

== Running a Report ==

indexterm:[running reports, creating reports, reports]

You can run one-off reports on demand or schedule recurring reports to run 
automatically. To run the report, you fill out the reports form to create a 
report definition, which tells Evergreen how to run the report, what information
 to include, and what type of output to provide you with.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section at the left of the screen, select the caret beside
 the _Templates_ folder to see your template folders. Use the carets to expand 
 the folder tree until you find the folder containing the template you would like
 to use for your report.
. Select a folder name to display the contents.
+
image::reporter_basics/template_selection.png["A screenshot of a subfolder in the left pane under My Folders has been highlighted. On the right, the check mark next to a template has been selected."]
+
. Double click on the desired template name or check the box beside the template
 you wish to use and then right click or use the *Actions* menu to select
 _New Report_.
. Enter a name for your report. Report names must be unique, or the report cannot
 be saved.
+
[TIP]
=====
A best practice for naming reports is to use the same name as the template you
 used. This makes it easy to track outputs and reports back to the template used.
 If multiple reports are made from the same template, the format of 'template 
 name' - 'report characteristic' can make those reports easy to track.
=====
+
. Optionally, enter a description for your report.
+
image::reporter_basics/report_description.png[Screenshot of the editable Report Name and Report Description fields on the left and the non-editable fields of Template Name and Template Description on the right. The report description reads 'Counts by permission group for Example Branch 4.']
+
. The display columns selected in the template are listed on the _Columns_ tab.
 You can navigate between tabs by clicking on the tabs or by using the *Previous*
 and *Next* buttons at the bottom of the screen.
+
image::reporter_basics/reports_columns.png[Screenshot of the columns tab on the report. Tabs are between the report name/description and the list of column fields.]
+
. On the _Filters_ tab, enter values for any filters. For more information on 
filter values, see 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#report_filters[Report Filters], below.
+

+
[NOTE]
======
Instead of scrolling through the options in the filter lists, you can place
 your cursor in the filter value box and then on your keyboard start typing the
 first few letters that the option you want starts with. This will limit your 
 list to just those options that match what you have typed.

Make sure you use the *Add* button after choosing each filter value to actually
 add it to your filter choices.

+
. On the _Layout and Scheduling_ tab you can make a number of choices about the
 final output. 
.. *Pivot Label Column* and *Pivot Data Column* are optional. Pivot tables are
 a different way to view data. If you currently use pivot tables to manipulate
 report data in Microsoft Excel, it is better to select an Excel output and 
 continue using pivot tables in Excel. Note that pivot tables are only suitable
 for some types of result data.
.. Select the checkboxes to _Choose your output format(s)_. Multiple options may
 be selected.
... Select the _Calculate grouping subtotals_ checkbox to add an unlabeled row
 or column with the subtotals for each grouping and an unlabeled grand total row
 or column. Note, group subtotals and grand totals will only be useful with some
 reports.
... _Excel output_ will create a file to export the data to Excel.
... _CSV Output_ will create a data file in comma-separated values format. This
 is the file format required to do a batch load on the *Item Status* screen.
... _HTML Output_ creates a simple table view of the data that is viewable in 
your browser environment. _HTML Output_ is sometimes referred to as tabular output.
... _Bar Chart_ will create a very simple bar chart of your data. Note, bar 
charts will only be useful with some reports.
... _Line Chart_ will create a very simple line chart of your data. Note, line
 charts will only be useful with some reports.
.. Leave the _Recurrence_ and _Scheduling_ options as is unless you are running
 a recurring report. See 
 xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#recurring_reports[Recurring Reports], below.
.. Optionally, enter an email address to send the report completion notification
 to. By default, this 
field will contain the email address saved in your staff account. Additional 
addresses can be added separated by a comma.
+
[NOTE]
======
The email will contain a link to the password-protected report output. Only 
staff members with permissions to view reports or have full access to the 
reporter will be able to open the report output.
======
+
.. On the right side of the screen, Choose the _Report Folder_ and _Output Folder_
 you would like to save the report and output in and then select *Save Report*.
. A confirmation will appear in the lower right of the screen indicating that 
the report has successfully saved. 
. Unless you have set a specific run time, the report will run right away. If 
your report has not completed after 15 minutes, you may need to contact your system administrator.
. Once the report is complete, you can view your output. See 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#viewing_report_output[Viewing Report Output], 
below. 

[[report_filters]]
=== Report Filters ===

indexterm:[report filters, reports]

The filters in a report template allow library staff to set the parameters on 
which the report runs. The ability to select values for certain filters when 
running a report means a single report template can be used multiple times to
 generate reports on slightly different data. For example, the same report 
template can be used to generate separate lists of items using particular 
circulation modifiers.

[[hardcoded_filters]]
==== Hardcoded Filters ====

Hardcoded filters are set when the report template is created. These filters 
cannot be changed when running a report. Common hardcoded filters include:

[options="header"]
|===
|Column |Transform |Action |User Params |Description 
|Bibliographic Record -> Record ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all 
records where the bibliographic record ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Call Number/Volume -> Call Number/Volume ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | 
Exclude all records where the call number ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Circulation -> Check In Date/Time |Date |Is NULL| |Include only items that have
 not been checked in.
|Circulation -> Circulating Item -> Copy Status -> Name |Raw Data |Equals | name
 of an item status | Include only items that are in the specified item status.
|Circulation -> Fine Stop Reason |Raw Data |Not in list |LOST | Exclude items
 that have stopped generating fines because they have been set to lost.
|Item -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only non-deleted items.
|ILS User -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only non-deleted patrons.
|===

[[report_date_filters]]
==== Date Filters ====

Date filters are generally set up to be a specific date, a specific month, or 
a date range. Date filters may include tips about how the dates should be 
entered. For instance, in a date range, the earlier date should always be 
entered in the first date box.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-1.png["Screenshot of a checkin Scan date/time date filter. Operator of between, filter values selected for the first and last dat of 2023. Transform is date. Highlighted in the lower left is a hint, enter the earlier date in the first box."]

If you'd like to include all possible data for your library in a report that 
specifies a time range, enter between "1900-01-01" and "today's date".

The transforms selected for the date filters will also control how users intend 
to use the results or present the options at the report definition stage.

* If you want a date picker widget, use the Raw Data or Date transform.
* If you want to filter based primarily on a comparison between the run time of
 the report and a timestamp column, use the Date, Month, or Year transform, and
 select Relative time value.
* If you want to filter based on the age of the timestamp stored in a column at 
report run time, use the Age transform.
* All other transforms have their uses, but the first 3 rules will cover almost 
all cases.

When running recurring reports, it's very important to use _Relative Dates_ in 
your filters. This will allow Evergreen to calculate the time period to report
 on each time it runs the report. A relative date of 1 month ago will generate
 a new report each month on the previous month's data; a real date of November
 2022 will generate the same report each month with the data from November 2022. 

[TIP]
=====
You can set up recurring monthly reports to show comparative data from one year
 ago. To do this, select relative dates of 1 month ago and 13 months ago.
=====

Use the _Relative time value_ checkbox under _Filter value_ to switch from a 
specific real date to a relative date. For a report filtering on month, you will
 be able to indicate how many months ago the report should look at. 

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-2.png[Screenshot of a checkin scan date/time. The relative time value box is selected. Instead of date fields with a calendar pickers there are fields for number of days ago.]

You can use a negative number in the filter value to indicate a future date, e.g., -3 months on the user privilege expiration date field to show users who will expire three months from the date of the report's run.

[[report_library_filters]]
==== Library Filters ====

All report templates used by libraries should include a library filter. This 
filter can look at the library specified in a variety of fields in the data 
including the checkout library, circulation library, owning library, patron's
 home library, and organizational unit.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-3.png["Screenshot of an organizational unit id filter. The filter value is displayed as a tree with checkboxes next to the unit names. In the lower left corner there is a highlighted hint that reads, check boxes for your library branch(es)"]

This filter is important as it allows staff to restrict the data in the report 
output to only data relevant to their library.

Multi-branch libraries can add specific branches or all of their branches to the
 list to get a report including data from the selected branches.

[[report_other_filters]]
==== Other Filters ====

While many filters will require staff to select values from a given list, some 
filters will require staff to type a value into the _Filter value_ field. In 
those cases, field hints, or 
xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#changing_column_documentation[column documentation], 
can be used to indicate how the text should be entered so that Evergreen can 
use the value and generate usable report output.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-4.png["Screenshot of an OPAC/Staff Client Username filter. The filter value field is a blank text field with an Add button next to it. If the lower left is a highlighted hint, enter one or more user names (e.g. br4dickinson) and click Add"]

Some reports will have just hardcoded filters defined at the template level and
 a single library filter that requires staff to enter a value, while other 
 reports will have multiple filters where staff need to enter values for the 
 library, dates, and patron or item data.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-5.png["Screenshot of three filters, creation date/time, is deleted, and OPAC/staff client username. Two of them have hints provided. The middle 'is deleted' had its value set at the template level and so there are no fields for users to specify."]

[[recurring_reports]]
=== Recurring Reports ===

indexterm:[recurring reports, reports]

Save time by scheduling recurring reports to run your regular reports 
automatically. Monthly circulation and patron registration statistics are good
 candidates for recurring reports.

Staff with access to the reporter can set up recurring reports to email a link
 to the password-protected report output to another staff member.

To set up a recurring report, follow the procedure in 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#running_reports[Running a Report], above, 
until you reach the _Recurrence_ and _Scheduling_ sections and then follow 
the steps below.
 
. Select the box for _Recurring Report?_.
. In the now visible _Recurrence Interval_ field enter your desired interval. 
Reports can run on a hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly interval.
+
[TIP] 
=====
The recurrence interval should correspond to the date filter. For example, if 
the template filters on a date (month, day, and year) instead of month, a 
recurring report running with a monthly interval may miss a day or capture an 
extra day's data. See xref:reporter_basics.adoc#report_date_filters[Date Filters]
 for more information on working with date filters on a recurring report.
=====
+
. Select _Schedule Report for Later_ and in the new date field set the date and 
time of the first run of the report.
+
image::reporter_basics/recurring_reports.png["Screenshot showing a checked box for recurring report and a recurrence interval of 6 months. The schedule report for later radio button is selected and in the date field 2 am on January 1, 2023, is entered."]
+
[NOTE]
======
Best practice is to always set recurring reports to run in the early hours of 
the morning (1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. server time).

Monthly recurring reports must be set to run on the 1st of the next month in 
order to capture all monthly data.
======
+
. Enter an email address to send the report completion notification to. By 
default, this field will contain the email address saved in your staff account.
 Additional addresses can be added separated by a comma.
+
image::reporter_basics/email_address.png[Screenshot of the email address field. Two addresses have been added. There is a comma but no space between the two.]
+
[NOTE]
======
The email will contain a link to the password-protected report output. Only 
staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter 
will be able to open the report output.
======
+

 Saved Successfully_. 
. Unless you have set a specific run time the report will run right away. If 
your report has not completed after 15 minutes, please contact your Evergreen 
administrator.
. Once the report is complete you can view your output. See 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#viewing_report_output[Viewing Report Output]

Once a report is finished, the output is stored in the specified _Outputs_ folder
 and will remain there until deleted. Your system administrator may have a script
 that automatically deletes report output after a certain period of time. 

If an email address was included in the report definition, Evergreen will send an 
email containing a link to the password-protected report output. Only staff members
 with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to

[[maintainting_reports_data]]
== Maintaining Reports Data ==

indexterm:[reports, reports data]

Saved report templates will stay in the database forever unless deleted by the
 template owner. Check with your system administrator to determine whether 
 report definitions and outputs are deleted on a scheduled basis. 

When a template or report definition is deleted, all the linked definitions and 
output files are also deleted. If you have shared your template and/or created a 
recurring report using your template, you will not be able to delete your template.
 This is why it is important for all users to clone templates into their own 
 folders before running reports.

It is recommended that you download outputs you need to keep as CSV or Excel 
output and save it locally on your computer hard drive or a shared drive.

[[maintaining_reports_templates]]
== Maintaining Your Report Templates ==

indexterm:[reports, reports templates]

As Evergreen evolves from version to version, the database tables sometimes 
change, and report templates should be periodically reviewed to ensure that 
they are running correctly and efficiently. It is especially recommended to 
review templates following an upgrade. You can check the create time of a 
template in the template folder grid.

image::reporter_basics/template_create_date.png["Screenshot of a template in a grid view. Columns displayed are Name, Description, Documentation, Date Created, and Owner. The date created column is highlighted."]

If you are modifying existing templates or creating your own templates, it is 
recommended that you delete any interim versions of the template created while 
working towards the final version of the template. This makes it easier to be 
sure you are using the correct version of the template.

[TIP]
=====
System Administrators should periodically review the scheduled and common reports
 and shared templates to ensure consistent usage. An example of a report to show 
 templates in use can be seen on the https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-reports:templates:reports[Evergreen Reports Wiki].
