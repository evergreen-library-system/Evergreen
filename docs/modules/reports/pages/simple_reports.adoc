Simple Reports implements a new reporting system focused on ease of use.
The Simple Reports interface guides a user through a streamlined reports
creation wizard and intentionally curtails the extensive options
available in the main Reports interface.

The Simple Reports interface is intended to provide an alternate access
point for running reports in Evergreen and is not intended to replace
the main Reports interface. In particular, users in need of complex
reports should still make use of the main Reports interface.

[[simple_reports_interface]]
== Simple Reports Interface ==

To access the Simple Reports interface, select *Administration → Simple
Reports*. You will see an interface with two tabs, *My Reports* and *My
Outputs*.

image::simple_reports/sr_my_reports.png[My Reports]

[[sr_my_reports]]
=== My Reports ===

The My Reports tab shows reports that you have created. Reports created
in this interface are tied to user accounts regardless of workstation,
and cannot be shared at this time. Actions available from this tab
include:

* *New* - creates a new Simple Report
* *Clone* - clones a Simple Report. You will need to save the new report
with a new name. This will clone the report format including basic
scheduling and output options. When you use the Clone action, your
cloned report will open in the Report editor.
* *Delete* - deletes a Simple Report and all of its associated outputs.
You can select and delete multiple reports.
* *Edit* - edits a Simple Report. This will overwrite the original report
but not change any existing outputs. _Exception_: if you edit the Report
name, this name change will be reflected on past outputs as well.
** If you edit the report recurrence interval, all report runs from that
point forward will use the new recurrence interval.


The My Reports tab defaults to sorting by Date Created (descending). To
sort differently, click on either the Report Name or Date Created column
header. Filters are also available for the Report Name and Date Created
columns. Filters are case-sensitive.

The My Reports tab includes these columns:

* _Report Name_ (displayed by default) - the name given to a report when
it was created or edited
* _Date Created_ (displayed by default) - the date and time a report was
created
*  _Last Edited_ (displayed by default) - the date and time of the most
recent edit to a report
* _Last Run_ (displayed by default) - the date and time of the most recent
run of the report
* _Next Run_ (displayed by default) - the date and time of the next
scheduled run of the report (recurring reports only)
* _Recurring?_ (displayed by default) - whether or not a report is
recurring
* _Simple Report Template ID_ (not displayed by default) - the database ID
associated with the Simple Report.

[[sr_my_outputs]]
=== My Outputs ===

image::simple_reports/sr_my_outputs.png[My Outputs]

The My Outputs tab shows outputs from your reports. Outputs are tied to
user accounts regardless of workstation. Actions available from this tab
include:

* *Refresh* - manually refreshes the tab to check for new report outputs
* *Delete Output* - deletes the selected output(s)

The My Outputs tab defaults to sorting by Finish Time (descending). To
sort differently, click on either the Report or Finish Time column
header. Filters are also available for the Report Name and Finish Time
columns. Filters are case-sensitive.

The My Outputs tab includes these columns:

* _Report_ (displayed by default) - the name given to a report when it was
created or edited
* _Finish Time_ (displayed by default) - the date and time a report output
was completed
* _Output_ (displayed by default) - shows hyperlinked button(s) which will
fetch the report output. Output options are chosen during report
creation.
** Output types CSV and Excel will download a file containing the output.
** Output types HTML, Line Chart, and Bar Chart will open a new browser tab
displaying the report output.
*** HTML output will generate a table. Column headers can be clicked to
change sorting of the table. The table can be printed via your browser’s
printing options.
*** Line Chart and Bar Chart outputs will generate an image that can be
downloaded by right-clicking and saving the image.
* _Error Text_ (not displayed by default) - the full text of a report
error. This information can help an administrator track down the source
of a report error. Hover over the error text to see the full error.
Sorting and filtering are available on this column.
* _Run ID_ (not displayed by default) - the database ID associated with
the Simple Report’s output.

[[sr_simple_report_types]]
== Types of Simple Reports ==

The Simple Reports interface intentionally only has a shortened list of
report types. It is possible to add report types in future development,
but the initial set was selected as representative of what most
frontline staff would need.

Simple Report types are as follows:

* _Circulation_ - reports focusing on library circulation
* _Collections_ - reports focusing on library collections (both bibs &
items)
* _Weeding_ - reports for weeding and collection maintenance which include
fields related to circulation, collection, and inventory
* _Patrons_ - reports focusing on library patrons. Note that patron type
reports will only display results for locations at which the staff user
has VIEW_USER permission.
* _Billings and Payments Transaction Summary_ - reports focusing on
monetary transactions

[[sr_create_simple_report]]
== Creating a Simple Report ==

To create a new Simple Report, click the *New* button from the My
Reports tab.

image::simple_reports/sr_new_report.png[New Simple Report]


You will be prompted to select a report type (report types are described
above):

* Circulation
* Patrons
* Collections
* Weeding
* Billings and Payments Transaction Summary

The Simple Reports interface will walk you through the process of
creating a report. You can save an in progress report at any time by
clicking *Save* and *Close*, and then go back to finish it later. You
must give your report a unique name in order to save it. Reports will
not run until output options are set and *Save and Schedule Report* is
selected.

image::simple_reports/sr_display_fields.png[Display Fields]

The *Display Fields* tab lets you select the fields and their display
order (i.e., column order) for your report. Depending on which report
type you select, a specified set of fields will be available to add to
the report.


[NOTE]
====
If you are familiar with the way the regular Reporter works in
Evergreen, you will notice that there are several fields that are new in
the Simple Reports interface. Some of these include:

* _Circ or Renew?_ (Circulation type reports) - this displays whether a
circulation transaction was an original checkout or a renewal checkout
* _Circulate?_ and _Holdable?_ (Weeding and Collection type reports) -
these use a combination of several pieces of item-level information that
calculate “circulatability” and “holdability”
* Date fields will often have several built-in display options such as
_Copy Create Date/Time_, _Copy Create Year_, etc. These fields will
display the date as described in the field name without needing to use a
Transform. You can use multiple kinds of these date fields in a single
Simple Report if needed.
====

On the left is an accordion menu which groups types of fields. All
report types have menu options for *Common Fields* and *All Fields*, as
well as groups of fields relevant to each report type. Select an option
from the left-hand menu to expand its list of fields, and select the
checkbox next to each field that you want to display as a column in your
report.

image::simple_reports/sr_select_display_fields.png[Select Display Fields]


As you select fields from the left, they will appear on the right under
*Field Display Order*.

image::simple_reports/sr_field_display_order.png[Field Display Order]


* You can remove a field by clicking the minus button on the left of this
area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the accordion
menu on the far left.
* You can adjust the display name of a field by clicking in the *Name* box
and typing in a new name. The original field name will show below the
Name box.
* You can adjust the way certain data will display by using the
*Transform* dropdown. Transform options will vary depending on the
fields you have selected, and in some cases will default to a specific
recommended transform value (e.g., fields that total payments will
default to a transform of “Sum”). Many fields are constructed to avoid
needing to use a transform, in particular date-related fields.
* You can use the arrows on the right to move fields up and down the list.
In tabular outputs, the list order top to bottom will determine the
order of column display from left to right. Sorting is controlled
separately, in the *Output Order* tab.

Once you have selected your display fields, click on the *Output Order*
tab. This tab allows you to assign individual column sort orders.

image::simple_reports/sr_output_order.png[Output Order]


On the left side of the screen you can rename columns, adjust
transforms, and reorder your columns in this tab in the same way you can
in the *Field Display Order* tab.

On the right side of the screen you can independently set sort orders on
each column as well as determine which column should sort first, second,
third, etc. The sorting is independent of the column display order,
which is an important difference from the standard Evergreen Reports
interface.

In the example above, the first three columns to display will be
_Library_, _Shelving Location_, and then _Title_, but the report will
sort first by _Library_, then by _Shelving Location_, and then by _Call
Number_.

To set sort order on a column, select the *Direction* dropdown. Choose
_Ascending_ or _Descending_ for each column. Sort order will typically
default to Ascending.

image::simple_reports/sr_sort_order.png[Sort Order]

Once you have established your sort orders, select the *Filters* tab.
This tab allows you to apply filters to your report. Note that some
fields are hidden from display but available for filtering, and
vice-versa; and there may be multiple display fields for the same data
(i.e.various names, shortnames, etc.) but only one field for filtering.

image::simple_reports/sr_filters.png[Filters]

As in the Display Fields tab, the Filters tab has an accordion menu on
the left which groups types of fields. Note that *Suggested Filters* are
those suggested for the report type generally, not the specific columns
you selected. Select an option from the left-hand menu to expand its
list of fields, and select the checkbox next to each field that you want
to use as a filter.

On the right, the columns you have selected for display in your report
will show under *Fields Selected for Display*, and your filter choices
will show under *Filter Fields and Values*.

image::simple_reports/sr_filter_fields.png[Filter Fields]

* You can remove a filter field by clicking the minus button on the left
of this area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the
accordion menu on the far left.
* You can adjust the way certain data will filter by using the *Transform*
dropdown.
** An example of using a filter transform is using the “Age” transform on a
Date field. Using this filter transform will give you a widget to enter
a number and select a time interval
* You can choose a filter operator using the *Operator* dropdown. Operator
values can vary for different filter fields, but common operators
include:
** _Equals_ - the report output will include rows exactly matching the
filter value
** _Does Not Equal_ - the report output will exclude rows exactly matching
the filter value
** _Is Null_ - the report output will include rows for which the filter
value is null (empty)
** _In List_ - the report output will include rows which are selected and
added to a list
*** Certain _In List_ filter options, such as Library Short Names, will
populate a dropdown for selection
** _Contains Matching Substring_ - the report output will include rows
matching the substring listed in the filter value.

In the example above, there are three filters on the report:

* Owning Library | In List | BR1, BR2 - the report will only show items
owned at BR1 and BR2
* Shelving Location | Equals | Fiction (SYS1) - the report will only show
items with the Fiction (SYS1) Shelving Location
* Item Deleted? | Equals | False - the report will exclude all deleted
items

Some other notes on filters in Simple Reports:

* Where possible, filters and filter values will show user-friendly names
rather than database IDs.
* If you are filtering on an Organizational Unit-related field like
Shelving Location, you will only see options which are visible to your
workstation location and its ancestors and descendants.
* Some Boolean filters (TRUE / FALSE) include a “Both” option which will
return results containing either value.
* To use a relative date filter (“X days ago”), select a date field with
Date/Time in its name, use the Age transform, and then choose you
interval (hours, days, weeks, months,
years):
+
image::simple_reports/sr_relative_date.png[Relative Date Filter]
+

Once you have chosen your filters, select the *Output Options* tab.

The *Output Options* tab contains the familiar Evergreen options for
report output, including recurrence and scheduling options, as well as
an option to email report output. Schedule times default to 15-minute
intervals but can be typed over if a different time is desired.

image::simple_reports/sr_output_options.png[Output Options]

Once you click *Save and Schedule Report*, your report will be saved and
either run immediately or scheduled to be run, and you will be taken
back to the main Simple Reports interface.

If you choose _Run Report Now_, your report output will be available in
the *My Outputs* tab once the report is completed. Scheduled report
output will be available in the *My Outputs* tab

[[sr_edit_simple_report]]
== Editing a Simple Report ==

To edit a report, select a report from *My Reports* and choose *Edit*
from the Actions Menu, or double-click on the report you want to edit.
Make changes as needed and select *Save and Schedule Report* once you’ve
made all of your changes.

[NOTE]
====
The edited report will not run (or be scheduled to run) if you
just select *Save*. You must select *Save and Schedule Report* in order
to execute the report.
====

Editing a report will overwrite the old report and generate new report
output, but you will still be able to see your old pre-edit report
output in the *My Outputs* tab.

* If you edit the Report name, this name change will be reflected on past
outputs as well - however, the name change may not be reflected on any
HTML outputs.
* Due to extant Reports architecture, it's possible for the report name
and output names to drift if you re-run reports or change their names
after the fact.
* If you edit the report recurrence interval, all report runs from that
point forward will use the new recurrence interval.

[[sr_admin]]
== Administration == 

[[sr_permissions]]
=== Permissions ===

New permission: RUN_SIMPLE_REPORTS

Access to Simple Reports is granted through a new RUN_SIMPLE_REPORTS
permission. This is a separate permission than the main RUN_REPORTS
permission and one is not required for the other.

Note that Patron type reports will only display results for locations at
which the staff user has the VIEW_USER permission.

[[sr_data_sources]]
=== Data Sources ===

Simple Reports defines Simple Reporter-specific data sources for its
reports that are defined as Evergreen IDL views. Here is some additional
information about these sources:

* Circulation (IDL class="srcirc"): Based on the `action.all_circulation`
(Combined Aged and Active Circulations) view
** There is no link from this view to user details, so there is no concern
that different staff could build the same report and get differing
results because of VIEW_USER permissions. However, it does include user
post code, profile, birth year, and home library so that certain
demographic information can be included.
* Patrons (IDL class="srusr"): Based on the core patron record and
includes card, address, statistical category, select notification
settings, and summary circulation counts.
* Collections (IDL class="srcp": Based on the item record and includes call number and title information. It joins in the `action.all_circulation` (Combined Aged and Active Circulations) view for the purpose of counting circulation activity and `action.all_inventory` to include inventory status information.
* Weeding (IDL class name = "srwd"): Based on the item record and includes call number and title information. It joins in the `action.all_circulation` (Combined Aged and Active Circulations) view for the purpose of counting circulation activity.
* Billings and Payments Transaction Summary (IDL class name = "srbps"): based on the `money.billable_xact` (billable transactions) view and joins in `money.all_billing`s and `money.all_payments` to aggregate billings and payments.

[[sr_idl_attributes]]
=== New IDL Attributes ===

Several new IDL attributes are part of the Simple Reports backend. These
allow an administrator many customization options for the Simple Reports
interface and its generated reports.

* Field groups are assigned with the `field_group="comma,separated,list"` attribute on the `<field>` element, defined in `<group>` elements inside the `<field_groups>` element.
* Fields are listed under the Suggested Filters group by adding the `sr:suggest_filter="true"` attribute to a field.
* Suggested transforms are applied with an `sr:suggest_transform="transform_name"` on individual field elements.
** Transforms can be forced by applying the `sr:force_transform` attribute instead
* The `force_filter` attribute is how permissions verification works, combined with a Simple Reporter-aware database function and the attributes below
* The `sr:hide_from="comma,separated,list"` attribute accepts the values:
** filter - hides a field from the Filters tab; used for textual names when
an id is better for filtering
** display - hides a field from the Display Fields tab; normally used for
ids when a name is available for display
** Both together - completely hides the field from the user; usually when using `force_filter`
* When forcing a filter, the `sr:force_filtervalues="freetext"` attribute allows you to specify the value to be filtered on.

The goal with these attributes is that Evergreen administrators can
heavily customize the interface of Simple Reports without affecting its
backend functionality, i.e., the extremely large SELECT statements that
make up the source definitions.

Administrators are encouraged to make these kinds of changes for their
end users, up to and including removing fields entirely. So long as the
SELECT statements are not altered the inner workings of the Simple
Reports installation are not changed and only the interface would be
different.
