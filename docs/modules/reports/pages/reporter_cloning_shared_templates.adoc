indexterm:[reports, cloning]

In Evergreen, reports are run from templates that can be used multiple times. 
Library staff can create their own templates or clone templates from other users
 or clone their own templates to make changes or modifications to the template.

When creating a new template, it is a good idea to review the shared templates 
first: even if the exact template you need does not exist it is often faster 
to modify an existing template than to build a brand new one. A Local System 
Administrator account is required to clone templates from the Shared Folders 
section and save them to My Folders.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one folder in _Templates_.
 If you have not done so, please see 
 xref:reports:reporter_folder.adoc#creating_folders[Creating Folders].

[[clone_known_folder]]
== Cloning from a Known Folder Location ==

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _Shared Folders_ section select the caret beside the _Templates_ folder
 to see the shared template folders. Use the carets to expand the folder tree 
 until you find the folder containing the template you would like to clone.
+

+
. Select the folder name to display the contents.
. Check the box beside the template you wish to clone.

[TIP]
=====
By default, Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all
 content, change the _Rows_ grid setting from _10_ to a higher number. Be aware 
 that using _100_ may cause performance issues in large-data systems.

. In the _Clone Template_ modal that opens enter a name for your template. 
By default, the system will take the original name and add _(Clone)_ to the end.
. Select *Confirm*.

[[template_search]]
== Searching for Templates ==

If you do not know the home folder for a template you desire, or if you want to 
explore templates shared by other accounts, you can use the reporter search function.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. Select the *Search* tab located above _My Folders_.
+
image::reporter_cloning_shared_templates/template_search.png[Screenshot of the Browse and Search tabs above the My Folders area.]
+
. Enter a search term in the field *Search Templates for String*.
. Scope you search to _Name_, _Description_, or _All Fields_.
. Limit your search to a particular folder using the carets beside the folder
 tree to locate your targeted folder, or leave the search at the _All Folders_
 level.
