== Data Types ==

indexterm:[reports, data types]

Every field that displays in the display field and filter options area of the 
xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#report_template_editor[Report Template Editor] 
is associated with a data type. This indicates what kind of information is stored
 in the field, and Evergreen will handle the information differently based on 
 the data type. Each data type has its own characteristics and uses. The type 
 of data will be listed next to the field name in parentheses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Data Type |Description |Notes
|Boolean |Contains either "true" or "false". |Examples in Evergreen: "deleted"
 in item/patron record, "circulate?" in item record.
|ID |Unique number assigned by the database to identify a record |IDs look like
 numbers, but the ID 
data type is treated specially by the software for determining how tables are l
inked. ID is a good candidate field for counting records.
|Integer |A number like 1, 2, 3. |Examples in Evergreen: "remaining renewal count"
 in circulation record, "claimed returned count" in patron record.
|Interval |Time intervals, such as "2 weeks" and "6 months" |Examples in 
Evergreen: "loan duration" and "grace period" in circulation record,
|Link |It is similar to the id data type. It is the id of a record in another
 table. |Examples in Evergreen: "user id" and "item id" in a circulation record.
 Link outputs a number that is a meaningful reference for the database but not 
 of much use to a human user. You will usually want to drill further down the 
 tree in the Sources pane and select fields from the linked table. However, in 
 some instances you might want to use a link field. For example, to count the 
 number of patrons who borrowed items, you could do a count on the "user id" in
 the circulation record.
|Money |Monetary amount |Examples in Evergreen: "price" in item record, "billing
 amount" in billing record.
|Org_unit |Organizational unit. It is a number. It acts like a link data type. |
In Evergreen, libraries are organizational units. In some contexts, they are o
rganized into a tree structure with consortium, library systems, and branches for 
library systems. To filter on a library, make sure you choose the field having 
org_unit data type. To display a library, it is a better option to drill down 
to the org unit record to display the "name" of it.
|Text |Text field. Usually it takes whatever is typed into the field. |Examples:
 "call number label" in call number record, "patron's names".
|Timestamp |A very detailed time such as 2018-11-25 17:54:26-07 |Example: checkout
 time in circulation record, last status date in item record.

[[report_field_transforms]]
== Field Transforms ==

indexterm:[field transforms, reports]

Transforms determine how data is processed when it is retrieved from the database.
 Different data types can be transformed differently. Not all transforms are 
 available for a certain data type. This table lists the commonly used transforms. 
 Some data types, like timestamp, will have additional transforms available when 
 adding fields or filters to a template.

[options="header"]
|===
|Transform |Applicable Data Types |Description | Notes
|Raw Data |All Data Types |To display the data exactly as it is stored in the 
database. | Most commonly used transform .
|Date |Timestamps | This transform presents a timestamp as a human-readable 
date in yyyy-mm-dd format. |For example, timestamp 2018-11-25 17:54:26-07 will
 be displayed as 2018-11-25. 
|Year \+ Month |Timestamps | Presents a timestamp as the year and month in yyyy-mm
 format. |For example, 2018-11-25 17:54:26-07 will be displayed as 2018-11. If 
 filtering on a timestamp transformed to Year + Month, all days in the calendar 
 month are included.
|Upper Case |Text | Transforms text to all upper case. |
|Lower Case |Text | Transforms text to all lower case. |
|Substring |Text | This transform can be applied to filters, not display fields.
 It matches the given value with a continuous string of characters in the field.
 |For example, if a given value is "123" and the match is with a call number 
 field, call numbers like "123.34", "ANF 123.34", "JNF 233.123", etc. will be in
 the result list.
|First Continuous Non-space string |Text | The first word (or string of numbers 
and/or characters until the first spacing) in a field is returned by this transform.
 |For example, this transform will return "E" from text "E DOR", "E 123", etc. 
|Count |Text, Integer, ID, Money, Timestamp, Org_unit | This transform counts the
 records found. |Though you can count by any field, very often id field is used. 
|Count Distinct |Text, Integer, ID, Money, Timestamp, Org_unit | This transform 
counts the number of records  with unique value in the field. If two records have
 the same value in the field, they will be counted once only. |A typical example
 of using Count Distinct is counting the number of active patrons who borrowed 
 items at a library. Each patron can be counted once only but they may borrow 
 multiple items. Transforming the patron id in circulation record with Count 
 Distinct will result in the required number. Since each patron has a unique id,
 they will be counted once only. 
|Max |Text, Integer, Money, and Timestamp | It compares the values in the field 
of all result records and then returns the one record with the highest value. 
For timestamp, the highest value meansthe latest date. |For example, if a checkout
 date is transformed by Max, the returned date is the last checkout date.
|Min |Text, Integer, Money, and Timestamp | It works the same way as Max except 
that it returns the lowest value. |

[[report_operators]]
== Operators ==

indexterm:[operators, reports]

Operators describe how two pieces of data can be compared to each other. They 
are used when creating filters in a template to determine which records should 
be included in the result. The record is included when the comparison returns 
"TRUE". The possible ways of comparing data are related to data type and data 
transforms. The available operators are:

[options="header"]
|===
|Operator |Description |Notes
|Equals | Compares two operands and returns TRUE if they are exactly the same. |
|Contains Matching Substring | This operator checks if any part of the field 
matches the given parameter. |It is case-sensitive.
|Contains Matching Substring (Ignore Case) | This operator is identical to 
Contains Matching Substring, except it is not case-sensitive. |
|Greater Than | This operator returns TRUE if a field is greater than your 
parameter. | For text fields, the string is compared character by character in
 accordance with the general rule that numerical characters are smaller than 
 alphabetical characters and uppercase alphabeticals are smaller than lowercase
 alphabeticals For timestamps, "Greater Than" can be thought of as "later than"
 or "after".
|Greater than or equal to |This operator returns TRUE if a field is greater than
 or equal to your parameter. | For text fields, the string is compared character
 by character in accordance with the general rule that numerical characters are
 smaller than alphabetical characters and uppercase alphabeticals are smaller 
 than lower case alphabeticals. For timestamps, "Greater Than or equal to" can
 be thought of as "later than or equal to" or "after or equal to".
|Less Than | This operator returns TRUE if a field is less than, lower than, 
earlier than, or smaller than your parameter. |
|In List| It is similar to Equals, except it allows you to specify multiple 
parameters and returns "TRUE" if the field is equal to any one of the given 
values. |
|Not In List | It is the opposite of In List. Multiple parameters can be specified.
 TRUE will be returned only when none of the parameters is matched with the value 
 in the field. |
|Between | Two parameters are required by this operator. TRUE is returned when the 
field value is Greater Than or Equal to the smaller given value and Less Than or 
Equal to the bigger given value. | The smaller parameter should always come first 
when filling in a filter with this operator. For example: between 3 and 5 is 
correct. Between 5 and 3 will return FALSE on the Reports interface. For timestamp,
 the earlier date always comes first.
|Is NULL | Returns TRUE for fields that contain no data.| For example, an overdue
 report will include a filter for Check In Date/Time is NULL as an item is no 
 longer overdue if there is a value for Check In Date/Time.
|Is NULL or Blank | Returns TRUE for fields that contain no data or blank string.
 | For most intents and purposes, this operator should be used when there is no 
 visible value in the field. |

[[report_filter_values]]
== Filter Values ==

indexterm:[filter values, report templates, reports]

If you enter hardcoded values for filter fields, the data must match exactly 
how it displays in Evergreen. For example, if the status is _Missing_ in 
Evergreen, you must use _Missing_; a value of _missing_ will not return results.

Multiple filter values can be included separated by commas.

If hardcoding a value for a library filter, you must use your library's unique 
Evergreen ID. Single-branch libraries may be able to  find this by opening 
their public catalog and looking at the URL that displays on the initial load.
 This URL will contain `physical_loc=X`. The value of X is your Evergreen ID. 
 Multi-branch libraries may need to contact their system administrator as the 
 URL for your public catalog will only show you the ID for your system, not 
 your branches.
