*Monograph Parts* enables you to differentiate between parts of monographs or other multi-part items. This feature enables catalogers to describe items more precisely by labeling the parts of an item. For example, catalogers might identify the parts of a monograph or the discs of a DVD set. This feature also allows patrons more flexibility when placing holds on multi-part items. A patron could place a hold on a specific disc of a DVD set if they want to access a specific season or episode rather than an entire series.

Four permissions are used by this functionality:

* CREATE_MONOGRAPH_PART
* UPDATE_MONOGRAPH_PART
* DELETE_MONOGRAPH_PART
* MAP_MONOGRAPH_PART

These permissions should be assigned at the consortial level to those groups or users that will make use of the features described below.

== Monograph Part Merging ==

The monograph part list for a bibliographic record may diverge from the proscribed format, resulting in multiple labels for what are essentially the same item. For instance, Vol. 1 may have variants like V.1, Vol 1, or Vol. 1 with a leading space before 'Vol.' Merging parts will allow cataloging staff to collapse the variants into one value.

In the Monograph Parts tab:

. Select the checkbox for all items you wish to merge including the one you wish to prevail when done - the "lead part."
. From the actions menu, choose _Merge Selected_. A modal will list the selected parts.
. Select the part that you wish to be the lead part and then select *Merge*.

The undesired part labels will be deleted, and any items that previously used those labels will now use the selected lead parts label.
