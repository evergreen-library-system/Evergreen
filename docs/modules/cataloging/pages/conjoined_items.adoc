The Conjoined Items feature enables catalogers to link items to multiple bibliographic records, allowing for more precise cataloging.  For example, catalogers can indicate items that are printed back to back, are bilingual, are part of a bound volume, are part of a set, or are available as an e-reader pre-load.  This feature also helps the user retrieve more relevant search results.  For example, a librarian catalogs a multi-volume festschrift.  She can create a bibliographic record for the festschrift and a record for each volume.  She can link the items on each volume to the festschrift record so that a patron could search for a volume or the festschrift and retrieve information about both works.

In the example below, records exist for a set of books and for individual volumes.  The librarian will link the item on the individual record to the bibliographic record for the set.

== Using the Conjoined Items Feature ==

The Conjoined Items feature was designed so that you can link items between bibliographic records when you have the item in hand, or when the item is not physically present.  Both processes are described here.  The steps are fewer if you have the item in hand, but both processes accomplish the same task.  This document also demonstrates the process to edit or delete links between items and bibliographic records. Finally, the permission a cataloger needs to use this feature is listed.

.Scenario 1: I want to link an item to another bibliographic record, but I do not have the item in hand

.Scenario 3: I want to edit the link between an item and a bibliographic record
 
*NOTE*: Do NOT attempt to edit the link through *Item Status*.  Doing so will add a second link rather than editing the existing one. Instead, follow the procedure below.

1. Make sure the record to which the item has been linked is marked for conjoined items (see previous scenarios).

2. Retrieve the original bibliographic record to which the item is attached.
 
3. In *Holdings View*, select the linked item and click the *Actions for Selected Rows* button *-> Link as Conjoined to Marked Bib Record.*
+
