[[item_tags]]
== Item Tags

Item Tags allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags to items.

Item tags are visible in the public catalog and are searchable in both the staff client and public catalog based on configuration.

This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to attach donation or memorial information to items, but may be used for broader purposes to tag items.

Item tags can be created ahead of time in the Administration and then applied to items or they can be created on the fly during the cataloging process.

See the xref:admin:copy_tags_admin.adoc[Item Tags administrative documentation] for more information.

Item Tags can be searched as Digital Bookplates in the public catalog if searching has been enabled via the Library Setting _Enable Digital Bookplate Search_.

*Advanced Search*

image::item_tags_cataloging/bookplate_advanced_search.png[Digital Bookplates Search Field Location in Advanced Search]

==== Keyword Search ====

Item Tags can also be searched by using a Keyword search in the Basic and Advanced search interfaces. Searches need to be constructed using the following syntax:

copy_tag(item tag type code, search term)

For example:

copy_tag(bookplate, friends of the library)

It is also possible to conduct a wildcard search across all item tag types:

copy_tag(*, smith)

[[item_alerts]]
== Item Alerts

The Item Alerts feature allows library staff to add customized alert messages to items. The item alerts will appear when a specific event takes place, such as when the item is checked in, checked out, or renewed.

Alerts can be temporary or persistent:

* _Temporary alerts_ will be disabled after the initial alert and acknowledgement from staff.
* _Persistent alerts_ will display each time the alert event takes place.

Item Alerts can be configured to display at the circulating or owning library only or, alternatively, when the library at which the alert event takes place is not the circulating or owning library. Item Alerts at check in can also be configured to provide options for the next item status that should be applied to an item. Library administrators have the ability to create and customize Item Alert Types and to suppress item alerts at specific org units. See the xref:local_admin:item_alerts_administration.adoc[Item Alerts Administration documentation] for more information.
