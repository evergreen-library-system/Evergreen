Item Tags allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags to items.  Item tags are visible in the public catalog and are searchable in both the staff client and public catalog based on configuration.  This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to attach donation or memorial information to items, but may be used for broader purposes to tag items.

Item tags can be created ahead of time in the Administration module (See the Administration section of this documentation for more information.) and then applied to items or they can be created on the fly during the cataloging process.

== Adding Existing Item Tags to Items ==

Item Tags can be added to existing items or to new items as they are cataloged.  To add an item tag:

. In the _Holdings Editor_, click on *Item Tags*.  A dialog box called _Manage Item Tags_ will appear.

..    If you are cataloging a new item, make any other changes to the item record.
. Click *Save & Exit*.  The item tag will now appear in the catalog.

NOTE: It is not possible to remove tags using the Item Bucket interface.

== Searching Item Tags ==

Item Tags can be searched in the public catalog if searching has been enabled via Library Settings.  Item Tags can be searched in the Basic and Advanced Search interfaces by selecting Digital Bookplate as the search field.  Specific item tags can also be searched using a Keyword search and a specific search syntax.

=== Keyword Search ===

Item Tags can also be searched by using a Keyword search in the Basic and Advanced search interfaces.  Searches need to be constructed using the following syntax:


copy_tag(item tag type code, search term)


For example:


copy_tag(bookplate, friends of the library)


It is also possible to conduct a wildcard search across all item tag types:

copy_tag(*, smith)
