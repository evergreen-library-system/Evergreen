= Cover Image Uploader =
:toc:

As of version 3.9, a staff user with appropriate permissions can upload
a cover image directly within a specific bibliographic record. Uploaded images will override images provided by a third party service like NoveList or Syndetics. Image uploads are
controlled by a permission, a library setting, and a global
flag described at the end of this page.

Acceptable file types are jpg, png, xpm, xbm, gif, and bmp. The formats
gd and gd2 are also supported, but these are unlikely to come up in
everyday use since they are internal formats in the libgd library used
for this feature. All uploaded images are converted to PNG at the time
of upload and scaled to small, medium, and large for various uses within
the OPAC and staff client.

The scaling algorithm will size images to fit the dimension of each
bounding box, while preserving aspect ratio. This means that the largest
dimension of any image will be scaled to match the bounding box. These
are hardcoded but can be adjusted by an administrator as a
customization.

* Small = 55px wide x 91px high
* Medium = 120 px wide x 200 px high
* Large = 475px wide x 787 px high

In stock Evergreen, images associated with a bib record will display in
the following locations:

* In the staff catalog search results list on the left side of the title
* In the staff catalog bib record details page on the upper left side of
the page
* In the OPAC search results list on the left side of the title
* In the OPAC record details search page to the left of the title.

== Uploading a Cover Image ==

From within the staff client, search for & retrieve a bib record. Under
*Other Actions* on the right is an action to *Upload Cover Image*.

Click the *Upload Cover Image* action to open a modal which will direct
you to select an image and upload it to Evergreen.

If there is an error uploading your file, you will be shown error text
in the modal. Error messages include the following:

* Not authenticated. Expired login?
* Not authorized. Check your permissions.
* Not found. Bib record deleted?
* Invalid global compression value. Talk to your system administrator.
* Do not know where to upload files. Talk to your system administrator.
* Can not save uploaded file. Talk to your system administrator.
* File size larger than configured limit. Check your library setting or
try a smaller file.
* Error parsing the image. Is it a common image filetype?
* Error uploading or processing file.

When the upload is complete the bib record will refresh and you will see
the small (thumbnail) version of your image in the upper left of the
record:

To see what the image looks like in the OPAC, you can click the *Patron
View* button. The Patron View button will open the OPAC in a new tab,
displaying the record as it appears to a Patron.

Once a new image is uploaded, memcache is flushed (analogous to clicking
“Clear Added Content Cache”). However, modern browsers can be very
sticky with their cache so if a user needs to see the new cover image
immediately, we recommend checking in a different browser.

== Administration

This feature uses a new permission, a new library setting, and a new
global flag.

* *Permission*
** UPLOAD_COVER_IMAGE - this is not added to any groups by default.
* *Library Setting*
** _Maximum file size for uploaded cover image files (at time of upload,
prior to rescaling)_ - Accepts an integer value in bytes specifying the
maximum pre-compression file size. If unset, this will default to
10737418240 (approximately 10GB).
* *Global Flag*
** `opac.cover_upload_compression` - accepts a numeric value from 0 (no
compression) to 9 (most compression). The default is 0. All uploaded
files are converted to png and use this flag.
