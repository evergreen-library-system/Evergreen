The Holdings Editor is the tool where you can edit all holdings data.

== Specific fields ==

=== Acquisitions Cost ===
indexterm:[acquisitions cost]

This field is populated with the invoiced cost of the originating acquisition.
This field will be empty until its originating acquisition is connected to an
invoice.

=== Item Number ===
indexterm:[copy number]
indexterm:[item number]

If you have multiple copies of the same item, you may want to
assign them item numbers to help distinguish them.  If you do
not include an item number in this field, Evergreen will assign your
item a default item number of 1.

== Accessing the Holdings Editor by barcode ==

. Click *Search -> Search for Items by Barcode*
. Scan your barcode.
. Right click on the entry in the grid.
. Click *Edit -> Call Numbers and Items* on the actions menu that appears.

== Accessing the holdings editor from a catalog record ==

The bibliographic record detail page displays library holdings, including the call number, shelving location, and item barcode. Within the
staff client, the holdings list displays a column next to the item barcode(s) containing two links, *view* and *edit*.

Clicking on the *view* link opens the *Item Status* screen for that specific item.

Clicking on the *edit* link opens the *Holdings Editor* screen for that specific item.

The *edit* link will only be exposed next to copies when the user has the *UPDATE_COPY* permission at the copy owning or circulating library. 

== Holdings Details Defaults ==

== Hiding Fields in the Holdings Editor ==


A user may hide specific fields in the holdings editor if these fields are not used for cataloging in their organization. Hiding fields that are not used by your organization helps to reduce confusion among staff and also declutters the holdings editor screen.

To hide one or more fields from the holdings editor:

. Retrieve the record.
