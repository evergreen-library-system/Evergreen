The Holdings Editor is the tool where you can edit all holdings data, including call number (volume) data as well as item-level data.

== Notes on specific fields ==

=== Acquisitions Cost ===

This field is populated with the invoiced cost of the originating acquisition. This field will be empty until its originating acquisition is connected to an invoice.

=== Item Number ===

If you have multiple items of the same item, you may want to assign them item numbers to help distinguish them. If you do not include an item number in this field, Evergreen will assign your item a default item
number of 1.

=== Item Tags, Notes, and Alerts ===

For information on item tags, notes, and alerts, please see the xref:cataloging:item_tags_cataloging.adoc[specific documentation for item tags, notes, and alerts].

== Accessing the Holdings Editor by barcode ==

Navigate to *Search -> Search for Items by Barcode*.

Scan your barcode or list of barcodes.

Right click on the entry in the grid.

Select *Edit -> Call Numbers and Items* on the actions menu that appears.

== Accessing the Holdings Editor from a catalog record ==

The bibliographic record detail page displays library holdings, including the call number, shelving location, and item barcode. Within the staff client, the holdings list displays a column next to the item barcode(s) containing two links, *View* and *Edit*.

Selecting the *View* link opens the Item Status screen for that specific item.

Clicking on the *Edit* link opens the Holdings Editor screen for that specific item.

The Edit link will only be exposed next to items when the user has the UPDATE_COPY permission at the item owning library.

== Editing attributes in the Holdings Editor ==

The Holdings Editor is where you can create or edit one or several items and call numbers. Call numbers are owned by an Organizational Unit, and items are individual items associated with a call number and Organizational Unit.

To change an item attribute, click on the attribute. Depending on the attribute, you will have a dropdown (which allows typeaheads), a numeric area, a text area, or a modal. Once you have made your edits to the field, click _Apply_. The styling of the field will change to show that edits are pending. Once you have finished making edits, select either _Apply All & Save_ if you wish to make more changes, or _Apply All, Save & Exit_ if you wish to save and close the Holdings Editor.

If you are editing a batch of items, the Holdings Editor will show all values of your currently selected items, including counts of which items have which attribute level. Any changes you make will be to all item attributes.

NOTE: Certain statuses, such as Checked Out, In Transit, etc. are considered “magical” statuses and cannot be edited from the Holdings Editor. If your batch contains item(s) with these statuses, you will not be able to update any item statuses in the batch.

As above, to change an item attribute, click on the attribute. Depending on the attribute, you will have a dropdown (which allows typeaheads), a numeric area, a text area, or a modal. Once you have made your edits to the field, click Apply. The styling of the field will change to show that edits are pending. Once you have finished making edits, select either Apply All & Save if you wish to make more changes, or Apply All, Save & Exit if you wish to save and close the Holdings Editor.

Since you are working in multiple items, you can choose whether to edit some or all items' values. To do this, select an element (in the example below, "Shelving Location") and select the values you wish to change using the checkboxes (in the example below, I unchecked "Display" because I don't want to edit that value). Then enter the new value you wish to apply to the selected items (I chose the new shelving location "New Arrivals"). The result of this workflow is that the Display item will remain in Display, and the two items that were in Audio/Video will be moved to New Arrivals.

NOTE: If you do not have permissions to edit an item or items in your set, you will see a warning dialog that informs you of this when you open the editor. You will be given the option to only show items which you can edit, to show all items in read-only mode, or to enter higher credentials via Change Operator. You can also exit the editor to select a different set of items.
