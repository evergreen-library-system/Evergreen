Search for Line Items from an Invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[acquisitions,invoices,searching for lineitems]

You can open an invoice, search for line items from
the invoice, and add your search results to a new or existing invoice.  This
feature is especially useful when you want to populate an invoice with line
items from multiple purchase orders.

In this example, we'll add line items to a new invoice:

indexterm:[acquisitions,lineitems,adding]

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *Create Invoice*.
. An invoice summary appears at the top of the invoice and includes the number
of line items on the invoice and the expected cost of the items.  This number
will change as we add line items to the invoice.
. Enter the invoice details (optional).  If you do not enter the invoice
details, then Evergreen will populate the *Provider* and *Receiver* fields with
information from the line items.  
+
NOTE: If you do not want to display the details, click *Hide Details*.

+
. Click the *Search* tab to add line items to an invoice.
. Select your search criteria from the drop down menu.  
. On the right side of the screen, *Limit to Invoiceable Items* is checked by
default.  Invoiceable items are those that are on order, have not been
cancelled, and have not yet been invoiced.  Evergreen also filters out items
that have already been added to an invoice.  Finally, if this box is checked,
and if your entered the invoice details at the top of the screen, then Evergreen
will filter your search for items that have the same provider as the one that
you entered.  If you have not entered the invoice details, then Evergreen
removes this limit.  
. Sort by title (optional).  By default, results are listed by line item
number.  Check this box to sort by ascending title.
. Click *Search*.

click *Add Selected Items to Invoice*.
+
.The rows that you selected are highlighted, and the invoice summary at the
top of the screen updates.

. Click the *Invoice* tab to see the updated invoice.
. Enter the number of copies for which you were invoiced, the amount that was
billed, and the amount that was paid.  The *Per Copy* field calculates the cost
of each copy by dividing the amount that was billed by the number of copies for
which the library paid.
. Save the invoice.  A new option, *Save and Clear*, saves the current invoice
and replaces it with a new invoice so that you can continue invoicing items.
