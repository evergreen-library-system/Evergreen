Requests can be placed and managed through both interfaces.

Actions for Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After placing a Patron Request, a variety of actions can be taken by selecting the request, or right-clicking, and selecting Actions within either *Acquisitions -> Patron Requests* or through the patron account under *Other -> Acquisition Patron Requests*:

* *Edit Request* - make changes to the request via the original request form.  Edits can be made when the status of a request is New.
* *View Request* - view a read-only version of the request form
* *Retrieve Patron* - retrieve the account of the patron who placed the request
* *Add Request to Selection List* - add the request to a new or existing Selection List in the Acquisitions module.  The bibliographic information in the request will generate the MARC order record.  From the selection list, the request will be processed through the acquisitions module and the status of the request itself will be updated accordingly.
* *View Selection List* - view the Selection List a request has been added to (this option will be active only if the request is on a selection list)
* *Set Hold on Requests* - allows you to indicate that a hold should be placed on the requested title, without needing to go in and edit the request.  You can set a hold as long as the status of the request is New or Pending.
* *Set No Hold on Requests* - allows you to indicate that a hold should not be placed on the requested title, without needing to go in and edit the request individually.
* *Cancel Requests* - cancel the request and select a cancellation reason

Administration

Request Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patron Requests will use the following statuses:

* *New* - This is the initial state for a newly created acquisition request.  This is the only state from which a request is editable.
* *Pending* - This is the state after a request is added to a selection list.
* *Ordered, Hold Not Placed* - This is the state when an associated purchase order has been created and the request's Place Hold flag is false.
* *Ordered, Hold Placed* - This is the state when the request's Place Hold flag is true, an associated purchase order has been created, and the bibliographic record and item for the request have been created in the catalog as part of the acquisitions process..
* *Received* - This is the state when the line item on the linked purchase order has been marked as received.
* *Fulfilled* - This is the state when an associated hold request has been fulfilled.
* *Canceled* - This is the state when the acquisition request has been canceled.

Notifications/Action Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following email notifications are included with Evergreen, but are disabled by default.  The notices can be enabled through the *Notifications/Action Triggers* interface under *Administration -> Local Administration*.  The existing notices could also be modified to place a message in the *Patron Message Center*.  Any enabled notifications related to holds placed on requests will also be sent to patrons.

This feature includes one new permission and makes use of several existing permissions.  The following permissions are required to manage patron requests:

* CLEAR_PURCHASE_REQUEST
** A new permission that allows users to clear completed requests
