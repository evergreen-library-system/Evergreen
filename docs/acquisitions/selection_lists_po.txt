Selection Lists and Purchase Orders
-----------------------------------

Selection Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selection lists allow you to create, manage, and save lists of items that you may want to purchase. To view your selection list, click Acquisitions -> My Selection Lists. Use the general search to view selection lists created by other users.

Create a selection list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selection lists can be created in four areas within the module. Selection lists can be created when you link:brief_records.txt[Add Brief Records], Upload MARC Order Records, or find records through the link:federated.txt[MARC Federated Search]. In each of these interfaces, you will find the Add to Selection List field. Enter the name of the selection list that you want to create in that field.

Selection lists can also be created through the My Selection Lists interface:

. Click Acquisitions -> My Selection Lists.
. Click the New Selection List drop down arrow.
. Enter the name of the selection list in the box that appears.
. Click Create.

Add items to a selection list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add items to a selection list in one of three ways: link:brief_records.txt[add a brief record]; upload MARC order records; add records through a link:federated.txt[federated search]; or use the link:federated.txt[View/Place Orders] menu item in the catalog.

Clone selection lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloning selection lists enables you to copy one selection list into a new selection list. You can maintain both copies of the list, or you can delete the previous list.

. Check the box adjacent to the list that you want to clone.
. Click Clone Selected.
. Enter a name into the box that appears, and click Clone.

Delete selection lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click Acquisitions -> My Selection Lists.
. Check the box adjacent to the selection list(s) that you want to delete.
. Click Delete Selected.

Mark Ready for Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After an item has been added to a selection list or purchase order, you can mark it ready for selector. This step is optional but may be useful to individual workflows.


. If you want to mark part of a selection list ready for selector, then you can check the box(es) of the line item(s) that you wish to mark ready for selector. If you want to mark the entire list ready for selector, then skip to step 2.
. Click Actions -> Mark Ready for Selector.
. A pop up box will appear. Choose to mark the selected line items or all line items.
. Click Go.
. The screen will refresh. The marked line item(s) will be highlighted pink, and the status changes to selector~ready.

Convert selection list to purchase order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Actions menu to convert a selection list to a purchase order.


. From a selection list, click Actions ~> Create Purchase Order.
. A pop up box will appear.
. Select the ordering agency from the drop down menu.
. Enter the provider.
. Check the box adjacent to prepayment required if prepayment is required.
. Choose if you will add All Lineitems or Selected Lineitems to your purchase order.
. Check the box if you want to Import Bibs and Create Copies in the catalog.

Purchase Orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activate Purchase Order with Zero Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, by default, a purchase order could be activated with or
without copies attached to line items.

In versions 2.3 and above, by default, a purchase order cannot be activated if a line item
on the purchase order has zero copies.  A new feature enables you to activate a
purchase order that lacks copies.

To activate a purchase order with line items that have zero copies, check the
box *Allow activation with zero-copy lineitems*.

Enhancements to Canceled and Delayed Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cancel/Delay reasons have been modified so that you can easily differentiate between canceled and delayed items.  Each label now begins with *Canceled* or *Delayed*.  To view the list, click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Acquisitions* -> *Cancel Reasons*.

The cancel/delay reason label is displayed as the line item status in the list of line items or as the copy status in the list of copies.

A delayed line item can now be canceled.  You can mark a line item as delayed, and if later, the order cannot be filled, you can change the line item's status to canceled.  When delayed line items are canceled, the encumbrances are deleted.

Cancel/delay reasons now appear on the worksheet and the printable purchase order.


Brief Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brief records are short bibliographic records with minimal information that are often used as placeholder records until items are received. Brief records can be added to selection lists or purchase orders and can be imported into the catalog. You can add brief records to new or existing selection lists. You can add brief records to new, pending or on~order purchase orders.

Add brief records to a selection list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click Acquisitions -> New Brief Record. You can also add brief records to an existing selection list by clicking the Actions menu on the selection list and choosing Add Brief Record.
. Choose a selection list from the drop down menu, or enter the name of a new selection list.
. Enter bibliographic information in the desired fields.

Line Items
~~~~~~~~~~

Return to Line Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature enables you to return to a specific line item on a selection list,
purchase order, or invoice after you have navigated away from the page that
contained the line item.  This feature is especially useful when you must
identify a line item in a long list. After working with a line item, you can
return to your place in the search results or the list of line items.

To use this feature, select a line item, and then, depending on the location of
the line item, click *Return* or *Return to search*.  Evergreen will take you
back to the specific line item in your search and highlight the line item with a
colored box.

For example, you retrieve a selection list, find a line item to examine, and
click the *Copies* link.  After editing the copies, you click *Return*.
Evergreen takes you back to your selection list and highlights the line item
that you viewed.
