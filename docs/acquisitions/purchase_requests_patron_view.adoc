Placing purchase requests from a patron record
----------------------------------------------

indexterm:[patrons, purchase requests]

Patrons may wish to suggest titles for your Library to purchase.  You can track these requests within Evergreen,
whether or not you are using the acquisitions module for other purposes.  This section describes how you can record
these requests within a patron's record.

. Retrieve the patron's record.

. Select Other --> Acquisition Patron Requests. This takes you to the Aquisition Patron Requests Screen.  CTRL+click or scrollwheel click to open this in a new browser tab.

. The Acquisition Patron Requests Screen will show any other requests that this patron has made.  You may sort the requests by clicking on the column headers.

. To show canceled requests, click the _Show Canceled Requests_ checkbox.

. To add the request, click the _Create Request_ button.
+
NOTE: You will need the CREATE_PURCHASE_REQUEST permission to add a request.
+
. The request type field is required.  Every other field is optional, although it is recommended that you enter as much information about the
request as possible.

. The _Pickup Library_ and _User ID_ fields will be filled in automatically. 

. _Request Date/Time_ and _User Barcode_ will be automatically recorded when the request is saved.

. _Notify by Email When Hold is Ready_ and _Notify by Phone When Hold is Ready_ will pull in preferences from the patron account if left blank, or can be set manually here.

. You have the option to automatically place a hold for the patron if your library decides to purchase the item.  If you'd like Evergreen to
generate this hold, check the _Place Hold_ box.

. When you have finished entering information about the request, click the _Save_ button.
