About This Documentation
------------------------

This guide was produced by the Evergreen Documentation Interest Group (DIG),
consisting of numerous volunteers from many different organizations. The DIG
has drawn together, edited, and supplemented pre-existing documentation
contributed by libraries and consortia running Evergreen that were kind enough
to release their documentation into the creative commons. Please see the
<<attributions,Attributions>> section for a full list of authors and
contributing organizations. Just like the software it describes, this guide is
a work in progress, continually revised to meet the needs of its users, so if
you find errors or omissions, please let us know, by contacting the DIG
facilitators at docs@evergreen-ils.org.

This guide to Evergreen is intended to meet the needs of front-line library
staff, catalogers, library administrators, system administrators, and software
developers. It is organized into Parts, Chapters, and Sections addressing key
aspects of the software, beginning with the topics of broadest interest to the
largest groups of users and progressing to some of the more specialized and
technical topics of interest to smaller numbers of users.

Copies of this guide can be accessed in PDF and HTML formats from http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/.

About Evergreen
---------------

Evergreen is an open source library automation software designed to meet the
needs of the very smallest to the very largest libraries and consortia. Through
its staff interface, it facilitates the management, cataloging, and circulation
of library materials, and through its online public access interface it helps
patrons find those materials.

The Evergreen software is freely licensed under the GNU General Public License,
meaning that it is free to download, use, view, modify, and share. It has an
active development and user community, as well as several companies offering
migration, support, hosting, and development services.

The community’s development requirements state that Evergreen must be:

* Stable, even under extreme load.
* Robust, and capable of handling a high volume of transactions and simultaneous users.
* Flexible, to accommodate the varied needs of libraries.
* Secure, to protect our patrons’ privacy and data.
* User-friendly, to facilitate patron and staff use of the system.

Evergreen, which first launched in 2006 now powers over 544 libraries of every
type – public, academic, special, school, and even tribal and home libraries –
in over a dozen countries worldwide.

Using the Public Access Catalog
===============================

Introduction
------------

Evergreen has a public OPAC that meets WCAG guidelines (http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), which helps make the OPAC accessible to users with a range of disabilities. This part of the documentation explains how to use the Evergreen public OPAC. It covers the basic catalog and more advanced search topics. It also describes the ``My Account'' tools users have to find information and manage their personal library accounts through the OPAC. This section could be used by staff and patrons but would be more useful for staff as a generic reference when developing custom guides and tutorials for their users.
