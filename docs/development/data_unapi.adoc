Using UnAPI
===========

URL format
----------

Evergreen's unAPI support includes access to many
record types. For example, the following URL would fetch
bib 267 in MODS32 along with holdings and record attribute information:

https://example.org/opac/extras/unapi?id=tag::U2@bre/267{holdings_xml,acn,acp,mra}&format=mods32

To access the new unAPI features, the unAPI ID should have the
following form:

  * +tag::U2@+
  * followed by class name, which may be
    ** +bre+ (bibs)
    ** +biblio_record_entry_feed+ (multiple bibs)
    ** +acl+ (shelving locations)
    ** +acn+ (call numbers)
    ** +acnp+ (call number prefixes)
    ** +acns+ (call number suffixes)
    ** +acp+ (items)
    ** +acpn+ (item notes)
    ** +aou+ (org units)
    ** +ascecm+ (item stat cat entries)
    ** +auri+ (located URIs)
    ** +bmp+ (monographic parts)
    ** +cbs+ (bib sources)
    ** +ccs+ (item statuses)
    ** +circ+ (loan checkout and due dates)
    ** +holdings_xml+ (holdings)
    ** +mmr+ (metarecords)
    ** +mmr_holdings_xml+ (metarecords with holdings)
    ** +mmr_mra+ (metarecords with record attributes)
    ** +mra+ (record attributes)
    ** +sbsum+ (serial basic summaries)
    ** +sdist+ (serial distributions)
    ** +siss+ (serial issues)
    ** +sisum+ (serial index summaries)
    ** +sitem+ (serial items)
    ** +sssum+ (serial supplement summaries)
    ** +sstr+ (serial streams)
    ** +ssub+ (serial subscriptions)
    ** +sunit+ (serial units)
  * followed by +/+
  * followed by a record identifier (or in the case of
    the +biblio_record_entry_feed+ class, multiple IDs separated
    by commas)
  * followed, optionally, by limit and offset in square brackets
  * followed, optionally, by a comma-separated list of "includes"
    enclosed in curly brackets.  The list of includes is
    the same as the list of classes with the following addition:
    ** +bre.extern+ (information from the non-MARC parts of a bib
      record)
   * followed, optionally, by +/+ and org unit; "-" signifies
     the top of the org unit tree
   * followed, optionally, by +/+ and org unit depth
   * followed, optionally, by +/+ and a path. If the path
     is +barcode+ and the class is +acp+, the record ID is taken
     to be an item barcode rather than an item ID; for example, in
     +tag::U2@acp/ACQ140{acn,bre,mra}/-/0/barcode+, +ACQ140+ is
     meant to be an item barcode.
   * followed, optionally, by +&format=+ and the format in which the record
     should be retrieved. If this part is omitted, the list of available
     formats will be retrieved.
