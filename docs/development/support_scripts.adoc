Support Scripts
---------------

Various scripts are included with Evergreen in the `/openils/bin/` directory
(and in the source code in `Open-ILS/src/support-scripts` and
`Open-ILS/src/extras`). Some of them are used during
the installation process, such as `eg_db_config`, while others are usually
run as cron jobs for routine maintenance, such as `fine_generator.pl` and
`hold_targeter.pl`. Others are useful for less frequent needs, such as the
scripts for importing/exporting MARC records. You may explore these scripts
and adapt them for your local needs. You are also welcome to share your
improvements or ask any questions on the
http://evergreen-ils.org/communicate/[Evergreen IRC channel or email lists].

Here is a summary of the most commonly used scripts. The script name links
to more thorough documentation, if available.

 * <<_processing_action_triggers,action_trigger_runner.pl>>
   -- Useful for creating events for specified hooks and running pending events
 * authority_authority_linker.pl
   -- Links reference headings in authority records to main entry headings
      in other authority records. Should be run at least once a day (only for
	  changed records).
 * <<_authority_control_fields,authority_control_fields.pl>>
   -- Links bibliographic records to the best matching authority record.
      Should be run at least once a day (only for changed records).
      You can accomplish this by running _authority_control_fields.pl --days-back=1_

authority_control_fields: Connecting Bibliographic and Authority records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[authority control]

This script matches headings in bibliographic records to the appropriate
authority records. When it finds a match, it will add a subfield 0 to the 
matching bibliographic field.

Here is how the matching works:

[options="header",cols="1,1,3"]
|=========================================================
|Bibliographic field|Authority field it matches|Subfields that it examines

|100|100|a,b,c,d,f,g,j,k,l,n,p,q,t,u

marc_export: Exporting Bibliographic Records into MARC files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[marc_export]
indexterm:[MARC records,exporting,using the command line]

The following procedure explains how to export Evergreen bibliographic
records into MARC files using the *marc_export* support script. All steps
should be performed by the `opensrf` user from your Evergreen server.

[NOTE]
Processing time for exporting records depends on several factors such as
the number of records you are exporting. It is recommended that you divide
the export ID files (records.txt) into a manageable number of records if
you are exporting a large number of records.

 . Create a text file list of the Bibliographic record IDs you would like
to export from Evergreen. One way to do this is using SQL:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT bre.id FROM biblio.record_entry AS bre
    JOIN asset.call_number AS acn ON acn.record = bre.id 
    WHERE bre.deleted='false' and owning_lib=101 \g /home/opensrf/records.txt;
----
+
This query creates a file called `records.txt` containing a column of
distinct IDs of items owned by the organizational unit with the id 101.

 . Navigate to the support-scripts folder
+
----
cd /home/opensrf/Evergreen-ILS*/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/
----

 . Run *marc_export*, using the ID file you created in step 1 to define which
   files to export. The following example exports the records into MARCXML format.
+
----
cat /home/opensrf/records.txt | ./marc_export --store -i -c /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml \
    -x /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml -f XML --timeout 5 > exported_files.xml
----

[NOTE]
====================
`marc_export` does not output progress as it executes.
====================

Options
^^^^^^^

The *marc_export* support script includes several options.  You can find a complete list
by running `./marc_export -h`.  A few key options are also listed below:

--descendants and --library
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `marc_export` script has two related options, `--descendants` and
`--library`.  Both options take one argument of an organizational unit

The `--library` option will export records with holdings at the specified
organizational unit only.  By default, this only includes physical holdings,
not electronic ones (also known as located URIs).

The `descendants` option works much like the `--library` option
except that it is aware of the org. tree and will export records with
holdings at the specified organizational unit and all of its descendants.
This is handy if you want to export the records for all of the branches
of a system.  You can do that by specifying this option and the system's
shortname, instead of specifying multiple `--library` options for each branch.

Both the `--library` and `--descendants` options can be repeated.
All of the specified org. units and their descendants will be included
in the output.  You can also combine `--library` and `--descendants`
options when necessary.

--items
+++++++

The `--items` option will add an 852 field for every relevant item to the MARC
record.  This 852 field includes the following information:

[options="header",cols="2,3"]
|===================================
|Subfield          |Contents
|$b (occurrence 1) |Call number owning library shortname
|$b (occurrence 2) |Item circulating library shortname
|$c                |Shelving location
|$g                |Circulation modifier
|$j                |Call number
|$k                |Call number prefix
|$m                |Call number suffix
|$p                |Barcode
|$s                |Status
|$t                |Copy number
|$x                |Miscellaneous item information
|$y                |Price
|===================================


--since
+++++++

You can use the `--since` option to export records modified after a certain date and time.

--store
+++++++

By default, marc_export will use the reporter storage service, which should
work in most cases. But if you have a separate reporter database and you
know you want to talk directly to your main production database, then you
can set the `--store` option to `cstore` or `storage`. 

--uris
++++++
The `--uris` option (short form: `-u`) allows you to  export records with
located URIs (i.e. electronic resources).  When used by itself, it will export
only records that have located URIs.  When used in conjunction with `--items`,
it will add records with located URIs but no items/copies to the output. 
If combined with a `--library` or `--descendants` option, this option will
limit its output to those records with URIs at the designated libraries.  The
best way to use this option is in combination with the `--items` and one of the
`--library` or `--descendants` options to export *all* of a library's
holdings both physical and electronic.

anchor:_pingest_pl[]

Parallel Ingest with pingest.pl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[pgingest.pl]
indexterm:[MARC records,importing,using the command line]

A program named pingest.pl allows fast bibliographic record
ingest.  It performs ingest in parallel so that multiple batches can
be done simultaneously.  It operates by splitting the records to be
ingested up into batches and running all of the ingest methods on each
batch.  You may pass in options to control how many batches are run at
the same time, how many records there are per batch, and which ingest
operations to skip.

NOTE: The browse ingest is presently done in a single process over all
of the input records as it cannot run in parallel with itself.  It
does, however, run in parallel with the other ingests.

Command Line Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pingest.pl accepts the following command line options:

--host::
    The server where PostgreSQL runs (either host name or IP address).
    The default is read from the PGHOST environment variable or
    "localhost."

--port::
    The port that PostgreSQL listens to on host.  The default is read
    from the PGPORT environment variable or 5432.

--db::
    The database to connect to on the host.  The default is read from
    the PGDATABASE environment variable or "evergreen."

--user::
    The username for database connections.  The default is read from
    the PGUSER environment variable or "evergreen."

--password::
    The password for database connections.  The default is read from
    the PGPASSWORD environment variable or "evergreen."

--batch-size::
    Number of records to process per batch.  The default is 10,000.

--max-child::
    Max number of worker processes (i.e. the number of batches to
    process simultaneously).  The default is 8.

--skip-browse::
--skip-attrs::
--skip-search::
--skip-facets::
--skip-display::
    Skip the selected reingest component.

--attr::
    This option allows the user to specify which record attributes to reingest.
It can be used one or more times to specify one or more attributes to
ingest.  It can be omitted to reingest all record attributes.  This
option is ignored if the `--skip-attrs` option is used.
+
The `--attr` option is most useful after doing something specific that
requires only a partial ingest of records.  For instance, if you add a
new language to the `config.coded_value_map` table, you will want to
reingest the `item_lang` attribute on all of your records.  The
following command line will do that, and only that, ingest:
+
----
$ /openils/bin/pingest.pl --skip-browse --skip-search --skip-facets \
    --skip-display --attr=item_lang
----



Importing Authority Records from Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[marc2are.pl]
indexterm:[pg_loader.pl]
indexterm:[MARC records,importing,using the command line]

The major advantages of the command line approach are its speed and its
convenience for system administrators who can perform bulk loads of
authority records in a controlled environment. For alternate instructions,
see the cataloging manual.

 . Run *marc2are.pl* against the authority records, specifying the user
name, password, MARC type (USMARC or XML). Use `STDOUT` redirection to
either pipe the output directly into the next command or into an output
file for inspection. For example, to process a file with authority records
in MARCXML format named `auth_small.xml` using the default user name and
password, and directing the output into a file named `auth.are`:
+
----
cd Open-ILS/src/extras/import/
perl marc2are.pl --user admin --pass open-ils --marctype XML auth_small.xml > auth.are
----
+
[NOTE]
The MARC type will default to USMARC if the `--marctype` option is not specified.

 . Run *parallel_pg_loader.pl* to generate the SQL necessary for importing the
authority records into your system. This script will create files in your
current directory with filenames like `pg_loader-output.are.sql` and
`pg_loader-output.sql` (which runs the previous SQL file). To continue with the
previous example by processing our new `auth.are` file:
+
----
cd Open-ILS/src/extras/import/
perl parallel_pg_loader.pl --auto are --order are auth.are
----
+
[TIP]
To save time for very large batches of records, you could simply pipe the
output of *marc2are.pl* directly into *parallel_pg_loader.pl*.

 . Load the authority records from the SQL file that you generated in the
last step into your Evergreen database using the psql tool. Assuming the
default user name, host name, and database name for an Evergreen instance,
that command looks like:
+
----
psql -U evergreen -h localhost -d evergreen -f pg_loader-output.sql
----

Juvenile-to-adult batch script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The batch `juv_to_adult.srfsh` script is responsible for toggling a patron
from juvenile to adult. It should be set up as a cron job.

This script changes patrons to adult when they reach the age value set in the
library setting named "Juvenile Age Threshold" (`global.juvenile_age_threshold`).
When no library setting value is present at a given patron's home library, the
value passed in to the script will be used as a default.

MARC Stream Importer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[MARC records,importing,using the command line]

The MARC Stream Importer can import authority records or bibliographic records.
A single running instance of the script can import either type of record, based
on the record leader.

This support script has its own configuration file, _marc_stream_importer.conf_, 
which includes settings related to logs, ports, uses, and access control.

The importer is even more flexible than the staff client import, including the
following options:

 * _--bib-auto-overlay-exact_ and _--auth-auto-overlay-exact_: overlay/merge on
exact 901c matches
 * _--bib-auto-overlay-1match_ and _--auth-auto-overlay-1match_: overlay/merge
when exactly one match is found
 * _--bib-auto-overlay-best-match_ and _--auth-auto-overlay-best-match_:
overlay/merge on best match
 * _--bib-import-no-match_ and _--auth-import-no-match_: import when no match
is found

One advantage to using this tool instead of the staff client Import interface
is that the MARC Stream Importer can load a group of files at once.
