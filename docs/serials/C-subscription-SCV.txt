Serials Control View
--------------------

As of Evergreen 2.4, the Serial Control View incorporates the Alternate Serial Control interface in the Subscription editor. Serial Control View enables you to manage serials in a single tabbed interface. This view also enables you to bind units. Serial Control View consists of five tabs: Items, Units, Distributions, Subscriptions, and Claims. Units and Claims are not functional in 2.4.

Create a Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A subscription is designed to hold all information related to a single serial title.  Therefore, each library is likely to have only one subscription per serial title.

image::media/scv-combined-sub.png[Subscription]

. Click the *Subscriptions* tab.
. In the tree on the left, select the branch that will own the subscription.
. Right-click to show the *Actions* menu, or click *Actions for Selected Row*, and click *Add Subscription*.
. Enter the date that the subscription begins in the Start Date field.
. Enter the date that the subscription ends in the End Date field. This field is optional.
. Enter the difference between the nominal publishing date of an issue and the date that you expect to receive your copy in the Expected Date Offset field. For example, if an issue is published the first day of each month, but you receive the copy two days prior to the publication date, then enter -2 days into this field.
. When finished, click *Save*. Or to exit the editor without saving, click *Cancel*.

[NOTE]
You can add notes to the subscription by clicking *View/Edit Notes*. These notes can also be accessed from the Items tab by right-clicking on an item and choosing *View Sub. Notes*. Also, the Notes column in the Items tab displays the total notes of each kind (Item notes, then Distribution notes, then Subscription notes).

Create a Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Distributions indicate the branches that should receive copies of a serial. Distributions work together with streams to indicate the number of copies that should be sent to each branch.

image::media/scv-combined-dist.png[Distribution]

. Choose a subscription from the list on the left
. In the panel on the right, click the *Distributions* tab
. Click the *New Distribution* button
. Enter your desired label in the Label field. It may be useful to identify the branch to which you are distributing these issues in this field. This field is not publicly visible and only appears when an item is received. There are no limits on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Select a Holding Library from the drop down menu. The holding library is the branch that will receive the copies.
. Select a Display Grouping
. Choose a Legacy Record Entry to attach to this serial record. The Legacy Record Entry contains the MFHD records that are attached to the bib record if the owning library is identical to the distribution's holding library. A distribution can thus be an extension of an MFHD record.
. Select a copy template from the Receive Unit Template drop down menu. This menu is populated with the copy templates that you created in Copy Template Editor.
. Select a Summary method. This determines how the Holdings Summary will treat the Legacy Record Entry (i.e. MFHD record) in relation to the Serial Control holdings data.
  * Add to record entry - Displays the MFHD holdings summary first, followed by the summary generated from the Serial Control received issues
  * Use record entry only - Displays only the MFHD holdings summary
  * Do not use record entry - Displays only the holdings summary generated from Serial Control received issues
  * Merge with record entry - Merges the two holdings summaries into a single statement
. Enter a Unit label prefix. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print in the Spine Label printing interface.
. Enter a Unit label suffix. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print in the Spine Label printing interface.
. Click the *Save* button to finish.

[NOTE]
Label, Holding Library, and Receive Unit Template are required fields when creating a distribution.

[NOTE]
Streams are created automatically in the Serial Control View. For information on using Streams in the combination Serial Control View, see <<_creating_a_stream,Creating a Stream>>.

image::media/scv-distr.png[Distribution]

. Click *Distributions* beneath the subscription from the tree on the left. Right click to show the *Actions* menu, or click *Actions for Selected Rows*, and click *Add distribution*.
. Apply a new label to the distribution. It may be useful to identify the branch to which you are distributing these issues in this field. This field is not publicly visible and only appears when an item is received. There are no limits on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Select a Summary method. This determines how the Holdings Summary will treat the Legacy Record Entry (i.e. MFHD record) in relation to the Serial Control holdings data.
  * Add to record entry - Displays the MFHD holdings summary first, followed by the summary generated from the Serial Control received issues
  * Use record entry only - Displays only the MFHD holdings summary
  * Do not use record entry - Displays only the holdings summary generated from Serial Control received issues
  * Merge with record entry - Merges the two holdings summaries into a single statement
. Apply a prefix to the spine label if desired. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print in the Spine Label printing interface.
. Apply a suffix to the spine label if desired. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print in the Spine Label printing interface.
. The holding library is filled in by default and is the library to which you attached the subscription.
. The Legacy Record Entry contains the MFHD records that are attached to the bib record if the owning library is identical to the distribution's holding library. A distribution can thus be an extension of an MFHD record. Select the MFHD record from the drop down menu.
. The Receive Call Number field is empty until you receive the first item. When you receive the first item, you are prompted to enter a call number. That call number will populate this drop down menu.
. The Bind Call Number field is empty until you bind the first item. When you receive the first item, you are prompted to enter a call number. That call number will populate this drop down menu.
. Receive Unit Template -  The template that should be applied to copies when they are received. Select a template from the drop down menu.
. Bind Unit Template - The template that should be applied to copies when they are bound. Select a template from the drop down menu.
. When finished, click *Create Distribution(s)* in the bottom right corner of the screen.
. A confirmation message appears. Click *OK*.

[NOTE]
You can add notes to the distribution by clicking *Distribution Notes*. These notes can also be accessed from the Items tab by right-clicking on an item and choosing *View Dist. Notes*. Also, the Notes column in the Items tab displays the total notes of each kind (Item notes, then Distribution notes, then Subscription notes).
