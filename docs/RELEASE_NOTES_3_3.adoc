Upgrade notes
-------------

Migrating Parent/guardian information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sites who traditionally store parent/guardian information in the
patron 'Secondary Identification' field can migrate values from this
field to the new guardian field with the following SQL:

[source,sql]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN;

-- 1. Find the local ID of the parent/guardian identification type

SELECT * FROM config.identification_type;

-- 2. On my test system, the id is "101".  It will vary!.
-- Migrate the value from the ident2 field to the guardian field.

UPDATE actor.usr 
    SET guardian = ident_value2 
WHERE 
    ident_type2 = 101 -- !! CHANGE TO SUIT
    AND ident_value2 IS NOT NULL 
    AND ident_value2 <> '';

-- 3. delete the original secondary identification data

UPDATE actor.usr 
    SET ident_value2 = NULL, ident_type2 = NULL
WHERE
    ident_type2 = 101; -- !! CHANGE TO SUIT

COMMIT;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Upgrading PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Evergreen now supports PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10.
If you upgrade your database from a PostgreSQL version of 9.5, or
lower, to PostgreSQL versions 9.6 or 10, you will need to recreate 3
indexes in additon to the normal database upgrade steps.  The index
recreation is necessary because of changes to the PostgreSQL
`unaccent` extension module.

The following snippet of SQL code will do the necessary steps:

[source,sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DROP INDEX actor_usr_first_given_name_unaccent_idx;
DROP INDEX actor_usr_second_given_name_unaccent_idx;
DROP INDEX actor_usr_family_name_unaccent_idx;
CREATE INDEX actor_usr_first_given_name_unaccent_idx ON actor.usr
      (evergreen.unaccent_and_squash(first_given_name));
CREATE INDEX actor_usr_second_given_name_unaccent_idx ON actor.usr
      (evergreen.unaccent_and_squash(second_given_name));
CREATE INDEX actor_usr_family_name_unaccent_idx ON actor.usr
      (evergreen.unaccent_and_squash(family_name));
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 


New Features
------------

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include Item Status in marc_export Items Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The marc_export script now includes the item status in the 852 subfield s when exporting items.

Ability to Reingest Certain Record Attributes In pingest.pl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An option, `--attr`, has been added to the `pingest.pl` support script
that allows the user to specify which record attributes to reingest.
It can be used one or more times to specify one or more attributes to
ingest.  It can be omitted to reingest all record attributes.  This
option is ignored if the `--skip-attrs` option is used.

The `--attr` option is most useful after doing something specific that
requires only a partial ingest of records.  For instance, if you add a
new language to the `config.coded_value_map` table, you will want to
reingest the `item_lang` attribute on all of your records.  The
following command line will do that, and only that, ingest:

----
$ /openils/bin/pingest.pl --skip-browse --skip-search --skip-facets \
    --skip-display --attr=item_lang
----



Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database Support for PostgreSQL 10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Evergreen database can now be built with PostgreSQL version 10.

This update has implications for developers who write PgTap tests.  In
versions of PostgreSQL prior to 10, one could write `\set ECHO` to
disable the echoing of commands as they were run.  In PostgreSQL
version 10, using `\set` without a value is an error.  One should now
write `\set ECHO none` in order to disable the echoing of commands.
This latter form works in all versions of PostgreSQL currently
supported by Evergreen.



Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen can now be installed on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver.  To
install the prerequisites, use ubuntu-bionic as the Makefile.install
target.

This update also fixes a Perl warning in the HoldNotify module that is
an error in the version of Perl (5.26) that is installed on Ubuntu
18.04.




Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

MARC Import/Export Interface Update (Angular Port)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This MARC Import/Export (AKA Vandelay) interface is now built on
Angular(7) instead of Dojo.  The functionality is consistent with the
previous version of the interface, with minor UI adjustments to match
the Angular style, plus one new interface called 'Recent Imports'.

Import Templates
++++++++++++++++
Users may now save sets of import attributes from the MARC import form as 
named templates.  Users may select a default template, applied on page load 
by default, and users may delete existing templates.

Recent Imports Tab
++++++++++++++++++
This is a new interface which allows users to see active and recent
Vandelay sesssions originating from the same workstation or logged in
user account.  Active sessions include real-time progress information so
the user may track the progress without refreshing the page.

This interface makes it possible to exit the main import tab or the
Vandelay interface altogether and return at a later time to check on
import progress.  It also allows users to start multiple imports at
the same time and follow the status of each in one interace.


Spine Label Sheet Printing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Catalogers can now print spine labels onto 8 1/2 x 11 inch label sheets.


Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron Parent/Guardian Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patrons now have a new dedicated parent/guardian field.  This field is 
editable in the patron edit interface, displays in the patron
summary side bar on the browser client, and is search-able from the
patron search interface in the browser client.

Patron Editor
+++++++++++++
In addition to the standard "show" and "suggest" visibility settings, 
the new guardian field comes with a library setting 
'ui.patron.edit.guardian_required_for_juv' ("GUI: Juvenile account 
requires parent/guardian").  When this setting is applied, a value 
will be required in the patron editor when the juvenile flag is active.

Allow Others to Use My Account (Privacy Waiver)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patrons who wish to authorize other people to use their account may
now do so via My Account.  In the Search and History Preferences tab
under Account Preferences, a new section labeled "Allow others to use
my account" allows patrons to enter a name and indicate that the
specified person is allowed to place holds, pickup holds, view
borrowing history, or check out items on their account.  This
information is displayed to circulation staff in the patron account
summary in the web client.  (Staff may also add, edit, and remove
entries via the patron editor.)

A new library setting, "Allow others to use patron account (privacy
waiver)," is used to enable or disable this feature.



Client
~~~~~~

Server and Booking Administration Moved To Angular
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Administration => Server Administration and 
Administration => Booking Administration pages have been ported to
Angular using the new Angular grids.  Entry points from both AngularJS
and Angular web clients point to the new interfaces.

Option to Enable Experimental Angular Staff Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new org unit setting labeled 'GUI: Enable Experimental Angular 
Staff Catalog' (ui.staff.angular_catalog.enabled) has been added, allowing
sites to enable a menu option in the browser client for accessing
the experimental Angular staff catalog.

When set to true, a new entry in the navigation bar appears in the
Cataloging menu labled "Staff Catalog (Experimental)".

New Features (Since 3.2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Pub date filter
 * Copy location filter
 * Group formats and editions
 * Identifier search
 * MARC search
 * Browse search
 * Place holds
 * Record baskets and actions
 * Record detail tabs/actions point to AngularJS versions where needed.
 * Record detail View In Catalog button



OPAC
~~~~

View upcoming booking reservations in the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new tab in the My Account section of the OPAC shows
patrons information about reservations on their account.
Here, patrons can check on upcoming reservations, as 
well as reservations they currently have checked out.

Note: this interface pulls its timezone from the Library
Settings Editor.  Make sure that you have a timezone
listed for your library in the Library Settings Editor
before using this feature.

Display UPC as Option for Public Catalog Advanced Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Numeric Search tab of the public catalog Advanced Search
now includes an option to search by UPC (Universal Product Code).
