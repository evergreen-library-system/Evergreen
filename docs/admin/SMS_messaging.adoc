SMS Text Messaging
------------------

The SMS Text Messaging feature enables users to receive hold notices via text message.  Users can opt-in to this hold notification as their default setting for all holds, or they 
can receive specific hold notifications via text message. Users can also send call numbers and copy locations via text message.

Authenticate Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

information without having to login to your OPAC account.

To disable the patron login requirement:
