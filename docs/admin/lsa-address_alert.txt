Address Alert
-------------

indexterm:[address alerts, address alert]

The Address Alert module gives administrators the ability to notify staff with a custom message when 
addresses with certain patterns are entered in patron records. 

This feature only serves to provide pertinent information to your library system's circulation staff during the registration process. An alert will not prevent the new patron account from being registered and the information will not be permanently associated with the patron account.

To access the Address Alert module, select *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Address Alerts*.

[NOTE]
==========
You must have Local Administrator permissions or ADMIN_ADDRESS_ALERT permission to access the Address Alert module.
==========

General Usage Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Alert staff when an address for a large apartment is entered to prompt them to ask for unit number.
- Alert staff when the address of a hotel or other temporary housing is entered.
- Alert staff when an address for a different country is entered.
- Alert staff when a specific city or zip code is entered if that city or zip code needs to be handled in a special way.  If you have a neighboring city that you don't have a reciprocal relationship with, you could notify staff that a fee card is required for this customer.

Access Control and Scoping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each address alert is tied to an Org Unit and will only be matched against staff client instances of that Org Unit and its children.

When viewing the address alerts you will only see the alerts associated with the specific org unit selected in the "Context Org Unit" selection box.  You won't see alerts associated with parent org units, so the list of alerts isn't a list of all alerts that may effect your org unit, only of the ones that you can edit.

The specific permission that controls access to configuring this feature is ADMIN_ADDRESS_ALERT.

Editing an Address Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make changes to an existing alert, double click on the alert in the list.  The editing form will appear, make your changes and click save or cancel when you are done.

Deleting an Address Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an alert or many alerts, click the selection check-box for all alerts you would like to delete.  Then click the "Delete Selected" button at the top of the screen.

Regular Expressions / Wildcards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the patterns entered to match the various address fields are evaluated as case-insensitive regular expressions by default.

[NOTE]
==========
Address Alerts use POSIX Regular Expressions included in the PostgreSQL database engine.  See the PostgreSQL documentation for full details. 
==========

If you want to do a case-sensitive match you need to prepend the pattern with "(?c)"

The simplest regular expression that acts as a wildcard is ".*", that matches any type of character zero or more times.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Match an apartment address to prompt for unit number.
- Match All Fields = Checked
- Alert Message = "This is a large apartment building, Please ask customer for unit number."
- Street (1) = "1212 Evergreen Lane.*"
- City = "mytown"

Match all addresses on a certain street.  Matches ave and avenue because of ending wildcard.
- Match All Fields = Checked
- Alert Message = "This street is in a different county, please setup reciprocal card."
- Street (1) = ".* Evergreen Ave.*"
- City = "mytown"
