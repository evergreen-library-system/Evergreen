Settings Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The settings are grouped together in separate tables based on functions
and modules, which are affected by the setting. They are in the same
sequence as you see in the staff client. Each table describes the
available settings in the group and shows which can be changed on a
per-library basis. At the bottom is the table with a list of
<<_data_types, data types>> with details about acceptable settings
values.

|Auto-extending grace periods extend for all closed dates|It works when the above setting "Auto-Extend Grace Periods" is set to TRUE. If enabled, when the grace period falls on a closed date(s), it will be extended past all closed dates that intersect, but within the hard-coded limits (your library's grace period).|True/False|

|Lost check-in generates new overdues|Enabling this setting causes retroactive creation of not-yet-existing overdue fines on lost item check-in, up to the point of check-in time (or max fines is reached). This is different than "restore overdue on lost", because it only creates new overdue fines. Use both settings together to get the full complement of overdue fines for a lost item|True/False|

|Max patron claims returned count|When this count is exceeded, a staff override is required to mark the item as claims returned.|Number|

If this setting contains a depth of 1 in such an installation, then every library in the System in which the Original Location belongs will be visible, and everything else will be hidden. A depth of 0 will effectively make every org visible. The embedded OPAC in the staff client ignores this setting.|Number|
