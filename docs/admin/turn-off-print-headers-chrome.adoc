^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not using Hatch for printing, you will probably want to configure
your browser so that Chrome does not add headers and footers to items printed
on certain printers.  For example, if you are printing spine labels, you likely
will not want Chrome to add a date or URL to the margins of your label.

You can turn off these headers and footers using the following steps:

. In the Chrome menu, click _Print..._ to open the print preview screen.
. Click _More Settings_.
. Uncheck _Headers and Footers_.
