indexterm:[acquisitions,line item,cancellation]

The Cancel reasons link enables you to predefine the reasons for which a line item or a PO can be cancelled. A default list of reasons appears, but you can add custom reasons to this list. Applying the cancel reason will prevent the item from appearing in a claims list and will allow you to cancel debits associated with the purchase. Cancel reasons also enable you to suspend or delay a purchase. For example, you could create a cancel reason of 'back ordered,' and you could choose to keep the debits associated with the purchase.

indexterm:[EDI,messages]
indexterm:[acquisitions,EDI,messages]


The EDI messages screen displays all incoming and outgoing messages between the library and the vendor.

Exchange Rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[acquisitions,exchange rates]

Exchange rates define the rate of exchange between currencies. Evergreen will automatically calculate exchange rates for purchases. Evergreen assumes that the currency of the purchasing fund is identical to the currency of the provider, but it provides for two unique situations: If the currency of the fund that is used for the purchase is different from the currency of the provider as listed in the provider profile, then Evergreen will use the exchange rate to calculate the price of the item in the currency of the fund and debit the fund accordingly. When money is transferred between funds that use different currency types, Evergreen will automatically use the exchange rate to convert the money to the currency of the receiving fund. During such transfers, however, staff can override the automatic conversion by providing an explicit amount to credit to the receiving fund.

Create an exchange rate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To create a new exchange rate, click _Admin -> Server Administration -> Acquisitions -> Exchange Rates_.

. Click New Exchange Rate.

Fund Tags
~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[acquisitions,funds,tags]

You can apply tags to funds so that you can group funds for easy reporting. For example, you have three funds for children's materials: Children's Board Books, Children's DVDs, and Children's CDs. Assign a fund tag of 'children's' to each fund. When you need to report on the amount that has been spent on all children's materials, you can run a report on the fund tag to find total expenditures on children's materials rather than reporting on each individual fund.

When the fund reaches its balance stop percent, it will appear in red when you apply funds to copies.
. Enter a Balance Warning Percent. The balance warning percent gives you a warning that the fund is low. You can specify any percent. For example, if you want to spend 90 percent of your funds and be warned when the fund has only 10 percent of its balance remaining, then enter 90 in the field. When the fund reaches its balance warning percent, it will appear in yellow when you apply funds to copies.
. Check the Propagate box to propagate funds. When you propagate a fund, the ILS will create a new fund for the following fiscal year with the same parameters as your current fund. All of the settings transfer except for the year and the amount of money in the fund. Propagation occurs during the fiscal year close~out operation.
