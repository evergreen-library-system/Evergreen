Notes about the Bibliographic Schema in the Database
----------------------------------------------------

Bibliographic fingerprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen creates a fingerprint for each bib record, which can be found in the `fingerprint` column of the `biblio.record_entry` table.
This fingerprint is used to group together different bib records in a Group Formats & Editions search in the public catalog.

The bibliographic fingerprint incorporates several subfields to distinguish between different items, including:

* $n and $p from MARC title fields to better distinguish among records of the same series that may share the same title but have a different part.

The bibliographic fingerprint distinguishes among the fields contributing to the fingerprint. This helps the system distinguish between a record
for the movie _Blue Steel_ and another record for the book _Blue_ written by Danielle _Steel_.
