Changes to marc_stream_importer.pl command line options
-----------------------

To work properly with Vandelay session tracking a --workstation
option is now required for the marc_stream_importer.pl script.
It needs to be an existing workstation name in your system and
if it is missing from the command line the script will fail and
you will be notified.
