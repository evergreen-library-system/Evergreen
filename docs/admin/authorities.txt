Authority Control Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The tags and subfields that display in authority records in Evergreen are
proscribed by control sets.  The Library of Congress control set is the default
control set in Evergreen.  In Evergreen release 2.2, you can create customized
control sets for authority records.  Also, you can define thesauri and authority
fields for these control sets.

Patrons and staff will be able to browse authorities in the OPAC.  The following
fields are browsable by default: author, series, subject, title, and topic.  You
will be able to add custom browse axes in addition to these default fields.

Control Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify the MARC tags and subfields that an authority record should
contain.  The Library of Congress control set exists in the staff client by

Thesauri 
~~~~~~~~

A thesaurus describes the semantic rules that govern the meaning of words in a
MARC record. The thesaurus code, which indicates the specific thesarus that
should control a MARC record, is encoded in a fixed field using the mnemonic
Subj in the authority record.  Eleven thesauri associated with the Library of
Congress control set exist by default in the staff client.  

To access an existing thesaurus, click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* ->
*Authorities* -> *Control Sets*, and choose the hyperlinked thesaurus that you
want to access, or click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* ->
*Thesauri*.


To add a *Thesaurus*:

. Click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Control Sets*,
and choose the hyperlinked thesaurus that you want to access, or click *Admin*
-> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Thesauri*.  
. Click *New Thesaurus*.  
. Add a *Thesaurus Code*.  Enter any single, upper case character.
This character will be entered in the fixed fields of the MARC record.  
. Add a *Name* to the thesaurus. Enter any number of characters.  
. Add a *Description* of the thesaurus.  Enter any number of characters.

Authority Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Authority fields indicate the tags and subfields that should be entered in the
authority record.  Authority fields also enable you to specify the type of data
that should be entered in a tag.  For example, in an authority record governed
by a Library of Congress control set, the 100 tag would contain a "Heading -
Personal Name."  Authority fields also enable you to create the corresponding
tag in the bibliographic record that would contain the same data. 

To create an *Authority Field*: 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Control Sets*.
. Click *Authority Fields*.  The number in parentheses indicates the number of
authority fields that have been created for the control set.
. Click *New Authority Field*.
. Add a *Name* to the authority field. Enter any number of characters.
. Add a *Description* to describe the type of data that should be entered in
this tag.  Enter any number of characters.
. Select a *Main Entry* if you are linking the tag(s) to another entry.
. Add a tag in the authority record.
. Add a subfield in the authority record.  Multiple subfields should be entered
without commas or spaces.
. Click *Save*.
