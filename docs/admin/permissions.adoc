User and Group Permissions
--------------------------

It is essential to understand how user and group permissions can be used to allow
staff to fulfill their roles while ensuring that they only have access to the
appropriate level.

Permissions in Evergreen are applied to a specific location and system depth 
based on the home library of the user. The user will only have that permission 
within the scope provided by the Depth field in relation to his/her working 
locations.

Evergreen provides group application permissions in order to restrict which 
staff members have the ability to assign elevated permissions to a user, and 
which staff members have the ability to edit users in particular groups.

Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New staff accounts are created in much the same way as patron accounts, using
_Circulation -> Register Patron_ or *Shift+F1*. Select one of the staff
profiles from the _Profile Group_ drop-down menu.

Each new staff account must be assigned a _Working Location_ which determines
its access level in staff client interfaces.

. To assign a working location, open the newly created staff account using *F1*
(retrieve patron) or *F4* (patron search).
. Select _Other -> User Permission Editor_

+
. Place a check in the box next to the desired working location, then scroll to
the bottom of the display and click _Save_.
+
NOTE: In multi-branch libraries it is possible to assign more than one working 
location

Staff Account Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view a detailed list of permissions for a particular Evergreen account go to 
_Administration -> User Permission Editor_ in the staff client.

Granting Additional Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A _Local System Administrator (LSA)_ may selectively grant _LSA_ permissions to 
other staff accounts. In the example below a _Circ +Full Cat_ account is granted
permission to process offline transactions, a function which otherwise requires 
an _LSA_ login.

. Log in as a Local System Administrator.
. Select _Administration -> User Permission Editor_ and enter the staff account 
barcode when prompted
+
OR
+
Retrieve the staff account first, then select _Other -> User Permission 
Editor_
+
. The User Permission Editor will load (this may take a few seconds). Greyed-out
permissions cannot be edited because they are either a) already granted to the 
account, or b) not available to any staff account, including LSAs.

1) List of permission names.
+
2) If checked the permission is granted to this account.
+
3) Depth limits application to the staff member's library and should be left at 
the default.
+
4) If checked this staff account will be able to grant the new privilege to 
other accounts (not recommended).
+
. To allow processing of offline transactions check the Applied column next to
_OFFLINE_EXECUTE_.
