Org Unit Proximity Adjustments

Org Unit Proximity Adjustments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Org Unit Proximity Adjustments allow libraries to indicate lending preferences for holds between libraries in
an Evergreen consortium.  When a hold is placed in Evergreen, the hold targeter looks for items that can fill
the hold.  One factor that the hold targeter uses to choose the best item to fill the hold is the distance,
or proximity, between the capturing library and the pickup library for the request.  The proximity is based
on the number of steps through the org tree that it takes to get from one org unit to another.

Org Unit Proximity Adjustments allow libraries to customize the distances between org units, which provides
more control over which libraries are looked at when targeting copies to fill a hold.  Evergreen can also be
configured to take Org Unit Proximity Adjustments into account during opportunistic capture through the
creation of a custom Best-Hold Selection Sort Order.  See documentation <<_best_hold_selection_sort_order,here>>
for more information on Best-Hold Selection Sort Order. 
 
An Org Unit Proximity Adjustment can be created to tell Evergreen which libraries to look at first for items to fill a hold or which library to look at last.  This may be useful for accounting for true transit costs or physical distances between libraries.  It can also be used to identify libraries that have special lending agreements or preferences.  Org Unit Proximity Adjustments can be created for all holds between two org units, or they can be created for holds on specific Shelving Locations and Circulation Modifiers.  
 
Absolute and Relative Adjustments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two types of proximity adjustments can be created in Evergreen: Absolute adjustments and Relative adjustments.  

Absolute proximity adjustments allow you to replace the default proximity distance between two org units.  An absolute adjustment could be made to tell the hold targeter to look at a specific library or library system first to find an item to fill a hold, before looking elsewhere in the consortium.  
 
Relative proximity adjustments allows the proximity between org units to be treated as closer or farther from one another than the default distance.  A relative proximity adjustment could be used to identify a library that has limited hours or slow transit times to tell the hold targeter to look at that library last for items to fill a hold.  

Create an Org Unit Proximity Adjustment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.To create an Org Unit Proximity Adjustment between two libraries:
. In the Administration menu choose *Server Administration -> Org Unit Proximity Adjustments*.
. Click *New OU Proximity Adjustment*.
. Choose an *Item Circ Lib* from the drop down menu.  
. Choose a *Hold Request Lib* from the drop down menu.
. If this proximity adjustment applies to a specific shelving location, select the appropriate *Shelving Location*  from the drop down menu.
. If this proximity adjustment applies to a specific material type, select the appropriate *Circ Modifier* from the drop down menu.
. If this is an Absolute proximity adjustment, check the box next to *Absolute adjustment?*  If you leave the box blank, a relative proximity adjustment will be applied.
. Enter the *Proximity Adjustment* between the *Item Circulating Library* and the *Request Library*.
. Click *Save*.

This will create a one-way proximity adjustment between Org Units.  In this example this adjustment will apply to items requested at by a patron BR4 and filled at BR1.  To create the reciprocal proximity adjustment, for items requested at BR1 and filled at BR4, create a second proximity adjustment between the two Org Units.
