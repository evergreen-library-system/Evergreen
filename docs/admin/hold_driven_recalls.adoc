In academic libraries, it is common for groups like faculty and graduate
students to have extended loan periods (for example, 120 days), while
others have more common loan periods such as 3 weeks. In these environments,
it is desirable to have a hold placed on an item that has been loaned out
for an extended period to trigger a 'recall', which:

  . Truncates the loan period
  . Sets the remaining available renewals to 0
  . 'Optionally': Changes the fines associated with overdues for the new due
    date
  . 'Optionally': Notifies the current patron of the recall, including the
    new due date and fine level

Enabling hold-driven recalls
----------------------------

By default, holds do not trigger recalls. To enable hold-driven recalls
of circulating items, library settings must be changed as follows:

  . Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor.*
  . Set the *Recalls: Circulation duration that triggers a recall
    (recall threshold)* setting. The recall threshold is specified as an
    interval (for example, "21 days"); any items with a loan duration of
    less that this interval are not considered for a recall.
  . Set the *Recalls: Truncated loan period (return interval)* setting.
    The return interval is specified as an interval (for example, "7 days").
    The due date on the recalled item is changed to be the greater of either
    the recall threshold or the return interval.
  . 'Optionally': Set the *Recalls: An array of fine amount, fine interval,
    and maximum fine* setting. If set, this applies the specified fine rules
    to the current circulation period for the recalled item.

When a hold is placed and no available copies are found by the hold targeter,
the recall logic checks to see if the recall threshold and return interval
settings are set; if so, then the hold targeter checks the currently
checked-out copies to determine if any of the currently circulating items at
the designated pickup library have a loan duration longer than the recall
threshold. If so, then the eligible item with the due date nearest to the
current date is recalled.

Editing the item recall notification email template
---------------------------------------------------
The template for the item recall notification email is contained in the
'Item Recall Email Notice' template, found under *Admin* -> *Local
Administration* -> *Notifications / Action Triggers*.
