The print templates follow W3C HTML standards (see
http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and can make use of CSS and
https://angularjs.org[Angular JS] to a certain extent.

The Receipt Template Editor can be found at: *Administration -> Workstation ->
Print Templates*

The Editor can also be found on the default home page of the staff client.

Receipts come in various types: Bills, checkout, items, holds, transits and
Payments.

Formatting Receipts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Print templates use variables for various pieces of information coming from the
Evergreen database.  These variables deal with everything from the library name
to the due date of an item. Information from the database is entered in the
templates with curly brackets `{{term}}`.

Example: `{{checkout.title}}`

Some print templates have sections that are repeated for each item in a list.
For example, the portion of the Checkout print template below repeats every item
that is checked out in HTML list format by means of the 'ng-repeat' in the li
tag. 

------
<ol>
<li ng-repeat="checkout in circulations">
<b>{{checkout.title}}</b><br/>
Barcode: {{checkout.copy.barcode}}<br/>
Due: {{checkout.circ.due_date | date:"short"}}<br/>
</li>
</ol>

Text Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General text formatting
|========================================================================================
| Goal         | Original     | Code                                            | Result 
| Bold (HTML)  | hello        | <b>hello</b>                                    | *hello*
| Bold (CSS)   | hello        | <span style="font-weight:bold;">hello</span>    | *hello*
| Capitalize   | circulation  | <span style="text-transform:capitalize;">circulation</span> | Circulation
| Currency     | 1            | {{1 \| currency}}                               | $1.00
|========================================================================================

Date Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not format dates, they will appear in a system format which isn't
easily readable.

|===================================================
| Code                         | Result
|{{today}}                     | 2017-08-01T14:18:51.445Z
|{{today \| date:'short'}}     | 8/1/17 10:18 AM
|{{today \| date:'M/d/yyyy'}}  | 8/1/2017
|===================================================

Currency Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add " | currency" after any dollar amount that you wish to display as currency.

Example:
`{{xact.summary.balance_owed | currency}}` prints as `$2.50`


Conditional Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use Angular JS to only print a line if the data matches. For example:

`<div ng-if="hold.email_notify == 't'">Notify by email: {{patron.email}}</div>`

This will only print the "Notify by email:" line if email notification is
enabled for that hold.

Example for checkout print template that will only print the amount a patron
owes if there is a balance:

`<span ng-if="patron_money.balance_owed">You owe the library
${{patron_money.balance_owed}}</span>`

Substrings
^^^^^^^^^^

To print just a sub-string of a variable, you can use a *limitTo* function.
`{{variable | limitTo:limit:begin}}` where *limit* is the number of characters
you are wanting, and *begin* (optional) is where you want to start printing
those characters. To limit the variable to the first four characters, you can
use `{{variable | limitTo:4}}` to get "vari". To limit to the last five
characters you can use `{{variable | limitTo:-5}}` to get "iable". And
`{{variable | limitTo:3:3}}` will produce "ria".

|========================================================================================
| Original                               | Code                                   | Result
| The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants  | {{checkout.title \| limitTo:10}}       | The Sisterhood of th

| Roberts                                | {{patron.family_name \| limitTo:3:3}}  | ber
|========================================================================================


Images
^^^^^^

You can use HTML and CSS to add an image to your print template if you have the
image uploaded onto a publicly available web server. (It will currently only
work with images on a secure (https) site.) For example:

`<img
src="https://evergreen-ils.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/copy-Evergreen_Logo_sm072.jpg"
style="width:150px;padding:5px;">`

Sort Order
^^^^^^^^^^

You can sort the items in an ng-repeat block using orderBy. For example, the
following will sort a list of holds by the shelving location first, then by the
call number:

`<tr ng-repeat="hold_data in holds | orderBy :
['copy.location.name','volume.label']">`

Subtotals
^^^^^^^^^

You can use Angular JS to add information from each iteration of a loop together
to create a subtotal. This involves setting an initial variable before the
ng-repeat loop begins, adding an amount to that variable from within each loop,
and then displaying the final amount at the end. 

------
<div>You checked out the following items:</div>
<br/>
<div ng-init="transactions.subtotal=0">                <!-- <1> -->
<ol>
<div ng-repeat="checkout in circulations">
  <li ng-init="transactions.subtotal=transactions.subtotal -- checkout.copy.price"> <!-- <2> -->
     <b>{{checkout.title}}</b><br/>
     Barcode: {{checkout.copy.barcode}}<br/>
     Due: {{checkout.circ.due_date | date:"M/d/yyyy"}}
  </li>
</div>
</ol>
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Total Amount Owed: {{patron_money.balance_owed | currency}}</div>
<div style="font-weight:bold;border:1px dotted black; padding:5px;text-align:center;">
You Saved<br/>
{{transactions.subtotal | currency}}<br/>              <!-- <3> -->
by borrowing from the library!</div>
------
<1> This line sets the variable.
<2> This adds the list item's price to the variable.
<3> This prints the total of the variable.

Exporting and importing Customized Receipts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your receipts set up on one machine you can export your receipts,
and then load them on to another machine.  Just remember to *Save Locally*
once you import the receipts on the new machine.

Exporting templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you can only save a template on to the computer you are working on you will
need to export the template if you have more than one computer that prints out
receipts (i.e., more than one computer on the circulation desk, or another
computer in the workroom that you use to checkin items or capture holds with)

. Export.  
. Select the location to save the template to, name the template, and click
*Save*.
. Click OK. 

Importing Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click Import.
. Navigate to and select the template that you want to import.  Click Open. 
. Click OK.
. Click *Save Locally*.
. Click OK.


WARNING: Clearing your browser's cache/temporary files will clear any print
template customizations that you make unless you are using Hatch to store your
customizations. Be sure to export a copy of your customizations as a backup so
that you can import it as needed.

TIP: If you are modifying your templates and you do not see the updates appear
on your printed receipt, you may need to go into *Administration -> Workstation
-> Stored Preferences* and delete the stored preferences related to the print
template that you modified (for example, eg.print.template_context.bills_current).
