Fine Accrual on Closed Dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, fines accrue only on dates that the library is open.  This feature
enables you to charge patrons fines on dates the library is closed. Fines accrue
during scheduled closings as well as during normal weekly closed dates.

To enable this feature:

. Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings* -> *Charge fines
on overdue circulations when closed*
. Click *Edit*.
. Set the value to *True*.
. Click *Update Setting*.   


Target Copies for Holds at Closed Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when a patron places a hold on a title, the hold targeter will
search for copies to fill the hold only at circulating libraries that are open.
Copies at closed libraries are not targeted to fill holds. When turned on, this
feature enables Evergreen to target copies that have closed circulating
libraries to fill holds. Two new org unit settings control this feature.

Use the following setting to target copies for holds at closed circulating libraries:

. Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor* ->
*Target copies for a hold even if copy's circ lib is closed* . Set the value to
*True* if you want to target copies for holds at closed circulating libraries.
Set the value to *False*, or leave it unset, if you do not want to enable this
feature.
. Click *Update Setting*.

Use the following setting to target copies for holds IF AND ONLY IF the
circulating library is the hold's pickup library.

. Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor* ->
*Target copies for a hold even if copy's circ lib is closed IF the circ lib is
the hold's pickup lib* . Set the value to *True* if you want to target copies
for holds at closed circulating libraries when the circulating library of the
item and the pickup library of the hold are 
the same. Set the value to *False*, or leave it unset, if you do not want to enable this feature.
. Click *Update Setting*.

Auto Override Patron Hold Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous versions of Evergreen, you can  assign patrons a permission that
enables them to manually override a failed hold.   In version 2.3, when a patron
places a hold in the OPAC that fails, and the patron has the permission to
override the failed hold, a new org unit setting automatically overrides the
failed hold rather than requiring the patron to manually override the hold.

In version 2.3, a new org unit setting exists so that the hold override occurs
automatically, and the patron does not have to choose to override it. To enable
this org unit setting:

. Click *Admin -> Local Administration ->Library Settings Editor*.
. Scroll or search to find _Auto-Override Permitted Hold Blocks (Patrons)_.
. Set the value to _True_.

*Use Case*

A patron has placed a hold in the OPAC on a title that he has currently checked
out. The patron permission group contains the permission,
_HOLD_ITEM_CHECKED_OUT.override_. In versions prior to 2.3, a hold
failure message appears, and the patron must click _Submit_ to override the hold. 

In version 2.3, with the appropriate org unit setting enabled, the hold success
message appears automatically, and the patron is not required to take further
action.

Org Unit Hiding in TPAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature enables you to hide specific org units from patron view in the OPAC.  Org units that have not inherited this setting will display in patron-facing dropdowns.

*To enable Org Unit Hiding in TPAC:*

1) Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor* -> *Org Unit Hiding Depth*.  Note: This setting is inherited.

2) Enter a value of 0, 1, or 2 as appropriate.  Values are described in the setting description.  To view the setting description, click the *Edit* link in the first column on the *Library Settings* interface.

3) Click *Update Setting*.


Accepting payments with Stripe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stripe (https://stripe.com) is a payment processing service that lets
sites take credit card payments without payment card information ever
touching the sites' own servers.

NOTE: Using Stripe as a payment processor means that clients *must*
have Javascript enabled in order to submit fine payments through your
OPAC.

Library Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following settings need to be set at the appropriate org level for
sites wanting to use Stripe. These settings can be found by clicking 
*Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor*


 * "Allow Credit Card Payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.payments.allow

 * "Enable Stripe payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.processor.stripe.enabled

 * "Stripe publishable key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.pubkey

 * "Stripe secret key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.secretkey

 * "Name default credit processor" (should be 'Stripe')

   credit.processor.default
