Turning off print headers and footers in Firefox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not using Hatch for printing, you will probably want to configure
your browser so that Firefox does not add headers and footers to items printed
on certain printers.  For example, if you are printing spine labels, you likely
will not want Firefox to add a date or URL to the margins of your label.

You can turn off these headers and footers using the following steps:

. In the Firefox menu, click _Print..._ to open the print preview screen.
. Click the _Page Setup..._ button.
. Go to the _Margins & Header/Footer_ tab.
. Make sure that all dropdown menus are set to _--blank--_.

If you only want to turn off those headers and footers for a specific
printer, use these steps:

. In the Firefox address bar, type link:about:config[].
. If a warning appears, click _I accept the risk_.
. Type _print_header_ into this screen's search box.
. Double-click on the relevant _print_headerleft_, _print_headerright_, and
_print_headercenter_ entries in the grid.
. Delete any existing data for that setting and click OK.
. Type _print_footer_ into the screen's search box and repeat these steps
for the footer settings.
