Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACQ Invoice Inline Lineitem Search and Add
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Invoice UI is how composed of two tabs, the main invoice tab and a new
Search tab.  The search tab consists of a subset of the Acquisitions unified
search interface.  The goal is to allow users to search for lineitems to
invoice.  Search results may be added directly to the growing invoice.  A number of small usability features are included.

Features
++++++++

    * Option (default) to limit searches to invoiceable items.  
        ** These are lineitems that are not cancelled, have at least one invoiceable copy, linked to a PO whose provider matches that of the current invoice, and are not already linked to the current invoice.
    * Search defaults to last-run search (on workstation).
    * New Lineitem Detail filter options
    * Sort searches by lineitem number (default) and title.
    * There is a new Expected Cost field which includes both the total invoiced cost plus the anticipated cost of lineitems as they are added.
    * New Price per Copy field
    * Lineitem count field
    * Show / Hide Invoice details button.  Details are displayed by default, but hidden when the user enters the search tab.  From there it remains hidden until manually shown (or a new invoice is opened).
    * A new "Save & Clear" button which saves the current invoice then clears the invoice display to create a new invoice.
    * Provider, shipper, and receiver fields are auto-populated from the first-added invoice data (when not already set).
    * Totals are now read-only, since they are derived from existing data (and are informational only).


EDI Invoices
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same setup that is required today for retrieving and reacting to EDI Order
Response messages (ORDRSP) will also react to Invoices (INVOIC).

This essentially means you must have a Provider (acq.provider) configured with
an EDI Account (acq.edi_account) containing login credentials for a vendor, you must have the edi_webrick service running (EDI translator), and you must have
the edi_pusher script run periodically by cron.

An open Evergreen invoice will be created for a each EDI Invoice message.
Evergreen invoice entries will be created for each lineitem detected in the
EDI message if that lineitem can be linked to a known Evergreen lineitem in
your system.  An Evergreen invoice item will be created for a whole-invoice
tax.

Enriched EDI
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for Enriched EDI with copy-level data via EDI in ORDER messages.

Encumbrance-only Rollover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new Library Setting allows the year-end close-out operation to roll over
encumbrances while dumping any unspent money.

Fund Report
^^^^^^^^^^^

A new IDL reporter view that provides summary information for funds for
reporting. The resulting table looks like a fund with four additional fields:
allocated_total, spent_total, encumbrance_total, and combined_balance.

OPAC
~~~~

TPAC: Simplified CSS Color Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CSS colors are now defined as a pair of Template::Toolkit files,
`Open-ILS/src/templates/opac/css/styles.css.tt2` and
`Open-ILS/src/templates/opac/parts/css/colors.tt2`. Evergreen administrators
can customize the color scheme for a given skin by copying `colors.tt2` into a
template override directory and adjusting the colors as desired.

Change required to eg_vhost.conf
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To enable Apache to pass the CSS file to the Template::Toolkit handler, you
must remove `.css` from the list of file extensions that should not be passed
to a handler in `eg_vhost.conf` as follows:

.From
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<LocationMatch ^/eg/.*(\.js|\.css|\.html|\.xhtml|\.xml|\.jpg|\.png|\.gif)$>
    SetHandler None
</LocationMatch>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.To
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<LocationMatch ^/eg/.*(\.js|\.html|\.xhtml|\.xml|\.jpg|\.png|\.gif)$>
    SetHandler None
</LocationMatch>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After making this change, restart Apache to make the change take effect.


Add to Permanent Bookbag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TPAC was modified to allow a logged-in user to add records from search
results and record summary screens to their permanent bookbags rather
than to a temporary bookbag that goes away when logged out.

Bookbag Selection Menu
++++++++++++++++++++++

The search results and record summary screens were modified so that
the "Add to my list" will show a menu when moused over by a logged-in
user.  This menu will display the option to add to a temporary
bookbag, the user's default list (if any), up to ten of the user's
other bookbags, a "See all" option to allow the user to choose one of
the bags not on the menu, and to create a new list and add the record
to it.

Choosing the temporary list from the menu will add the record to the
temporary my list as TPAC does before the addition of this feature.

Choosing a named list will add the record to the chosen list.

Choosing "See all" or "Add to new list" will take the user to their My
Lists page.  (The only difference being that "See all" will actually
list all of the user's bookbags if they have more than the current
limit.)  The My Lists page will have a new button "Add to this list"
next to each of their existing lists.  In addition, if the user
creates a new list on this screen, the selected record will
automatically be added to this new list.

You can tell all of the above is working if you are redirected to your
search results or record summary after adding to a list.  If there was
a problem, you will get either an error page or will see your My Lists
page.

Designating a Default Bookbag/list
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The user's My List screen has had a 'Make Default List' button added
for each list.  Clicking the button will cause that list to be
registered as the user's default list.  This is the list that will be
added to when a user chooses the Default List option on the Add to my
list menu in search or record summary.

The current default list has a 'Remove Default List' button next to
it.  Clicking this button will unset the default status of the list
and return to a state of having no default list.

One handy way that users may want to use this feature is to create a
new list, and then designate it as the default.  This list could then
be used to add records from searches based on a current topic of
interest.  Changing the default list is so easy that users may want to
do so when changing search topics in order to keep their results
better organized.

A Note on CSS Styles
++++++++++++++++++++

If a user has a bookbag with an overly long name, the end of it will
jut out past the right margin of the menu in FireFox and several other
browsers.  To change this behavior, you may want to edit the `.popmenu
li:hover li a` css entry in `web/css/skin/default/opac/style.css` by
adding an `overflow` property.  If you desire to have the longer names
clipped to the size ofthe menu then add `overlow: hidden`.  If you
prefer to have a scroll bar for oversized entries, then add `overflow:
auto`.


Warn When Adding to a Temporary Bookbag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TPAC has been modified so that a user will see a warning before adding
a record to a temporary bookbag.  This message serves to inform the
user that they are adding to a temporary list that will disappear when
their session ends.

A new org. unit setting has been added,
opac.patron.temporary_list_warn, that will enable this warning when
set.  Sites may choose not to display this warning.

The user may also set a preference in their search preferences to
disable this warning.  The setting only works when a user is logged
in, of course.

Kid's OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^

The Kids OPAC (KPAC) is a public catalog search that was designed for children
and teens.  Colorful menu items,large buttons, and simple navigation make this
an appealing search interface for kids.  Librarians will appreciate the flexible
configuration of the KPAC.  Librarians can create links to canned search results
for kids and can apply these links by branch.  The KPAC uses the same infrastructure
as the Template Toolkit OPAC (TPAC), the adult catalog search, so you can easily
extend the KPAC using the code that already exists in the TPAC.  Finally, third
party content, such as reader reviews, can be integrated into the KPAC.


Locale picker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In situations in which more than a single locale is configured, the TPAC header
will display a locale picker based on the registered locales. 

Hidden Place Hold Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The title-level 'Place Hold' link in TPAC will be hidden on the search result
and record summary screens when there are no holdable copies on the bib. This
is based on the copy, status and location holdable flags.

When enabled in config.tt2, the 'Place Holds' link in TPAC will also be hidden
if copies are available in the search location. 

Library Selectors in Advanced Searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library selector is now available on the numeric and expert search pages.

Journal Title Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A journal title search is now available as a stock TPAC filter.

Public Patron Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Public patron notes are now visible in the 'Account Summary' box of 'My
Account'.

Auto-Override Permissable Patron Hold Fail Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new Library Setting is available that tells TPAC to automatically override
hold placement failure events in cases where the patron has the permission to
do so. The goal is to skip the confirmation step previously required by patrons
when overriding a TPAC hold.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

Z39.50 Source Attributes Management Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a new interface for managing Z39.50 attributes on a Z39.50
source.  The interface is linked from each source name in the Z39.50
Source administrative interface.

Cloning
+++++++

In addition to attribute creation, deletion, and editing, it's also 
possible to clone a set of attributes from one source into another.
When cloning, any attributes present in the cloned source that are
not present in the destination source are copied into the destination 
source.

Vandelay (MARC Import/Export) Copy Overlay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vandelay Item Attributes (Cataloging -> MARC Import / 
Export -> Import Item Attribute Definitions) contains 
a new field called "Overlay Match ID".  The presence of data 
in this field extracted from an import-item copy indicates 
to the Vandelay import process that a copy overlay is requested 
instead of new copy creation.  The value for the field is the 
copy id for bib record queues and the ACQ lineitem_detail ID for 
Acquisitions Queues.  For either type of queue, however, overlay 
occurs against a real copy (asset.copy).  In the ACQ queue case, 
we use the lineitem_detail ID because this is the data ACQ 
providers and sub-systems will have access to.

When a match point ID value is a set and a matching copy is found, 
the values extracted from the inbound copy data are used to replace 
values on the existing found copy, including the call-number label.  
Any fields on the inbound copy that are empty are ignored.

One use case for this feature are shelf-ready items produced by a 
3rd-party (e.g. ACQ provider) and delivered to the library via MARC
file for upload.  The file might contain improved MARC bibliographic
data as well as real barcodes (i.e. not temporary ACQ generated 
barcodes) for the copies already purchased through the vendor.

Permission
++++++++++

This adds a new permission called IMPORT_OVERLAY_COPY which is 
required to perform the copy overlay step.

Regardless of permission, it is not possible to overlay values on
a copy unless the imported bib record links (creates/overlays/merges)
to/with the owning bib record for the copy to be overlaid.  This is 
both for security and removal of a potent foot-gun.

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplified Hold Pull List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a new hold pull list interface based on the Flattener service that's
designed to perform faster than existing pull list interfaces, both in staff
client display and printing.

Sorting
+++++++

You can sort on any one column by clicking on it.  Click again to reverse
direction.  This is typical of similar interfaces.

Now you can also sort by multiple columns.  Right click the column headers of
the grid in the pull list interface to get a dialog that allows you to sort
by multiple columns, in any order.

Column Picking
++++++++++++++

The same dialog that allows you to choose multiple sort columns (accessed by
right clicking any column header) also allows you to toggle the display of any
column available to the pull list on or off.

Persistence
+++++++++++

Once saved, your changes in this dialog persist for your user account.  Column
display, display order, and `sorting choices affect printing as well as
displayed output.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search Filter Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Search filter groups support the collection of free-form search queries into
named groups of named filters which can be applied to searches.  The purpose 
is to allow systems to fine tune filters in the catalog.

Editing the groups and their entries is done in the staff client at
Admin -> Local Administration -> Search Filter Groups.

Example
+++++++

Consider a new filter called "reading_level".  It uses a combination of 
MARC audience and shelving location to differentiate items.  It might have
entries that look like this:

Children's Materials => audience(a,b,c) locations(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

Young Adult => audience(j,d) locations(5,6,7,8,9,10)

Adult => audience(e,f,g, ) -locations(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

Using the filter in a template
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[source, html]
---------------------------------------------------
<span>[% ctx.filter_groups.reading_level.label %]</span>
<span>
[%
    INCLUDE 'opac/parts/filter_group_selector.tt2'
    filter_group='reading_level'
    none_ok=1
    none_label=l('All')
%]
</span>
---------------------------------------------------

Standing Penalty CAPTURE and FULFILL Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature adds two additional types of standing penalty blocks to manage
holds. 

When a user has a standing penalty containing 'CAPTURE' in the block list, the
user can place holds (pending no 'HOLD' block), but no holds for the user will
be captured. This is effectively a policy-based freeze of the hold.

Users that have penalties with 'FULFILL' in the block list will be able to
place holds and have their holds captured (i.e. delivered) but will not be able
to check out the captured holds. This is basically a way to get patrons in to
pay outstanding balances.

Copy Location Additions to Circulation Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to circulation modifiers, circ policies can now be based on copy
location. This also adds copy location to the circ matrix weights and to circ
limit sets.

Staff Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~

XULRunner / Firefox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Support for later versions of XULRunner is included, which means that later
improvements to XULRunner can be taken advantage of. This also means that the
Firefox extension mode works in Firefox 3.6+, though some frequent tweaking
will be needed due to the rapid Firefox major release schedule.

The majority of the actual changes are backend changes, but there are some
significant things to note for local customizations.

Remote XUL
++++++++++
Remote XUL no longer works in XULRunner/Firefox 4+, but to work around it a
custom extension now creates an oils:// wrapper. Within the staff client that
wrapper contains a "remote" host, from which server-side XUL can be loaded.

Custom XUL pages stored on the server will need to reference the new wrapper
to function.

As a note: The new wrapper is used for all OPAC access and only talks SSL.

enablePrivilege
+++++++++++++++
The enablePrivilege command that would allow code to access various protected
functionality is no longer available. Any code that depended upon it will need
to be adjusted to use the oils:// wrapper created for Remote XUL.

Cookies
+++++++
Unfortunately, the oils:// wrapper has one less than useful effect. Any
JavaScript loaded via it loses access to cookies. This is most notable when you
are dealing with authtoken cookies. This only applies to JavaScript, however,
and the server can still see the cookies when it gets requests.

As a workaround you can load the data stash and fetch authtokens via it instead.
This should always work when using the oils:// wrapper due to the elevated
permission set it gets (nearly, if not equal to, local XUL).

url_prefix
++++++++++
Finally, as a useful feature, the url_prefix function is now slightly easier to
use. Instead of needing to reference urls.SOMETHING you can instead just put the
SOMETHING at the start of the url to prefix:

url_prefix('SOMETHING/stuff.html')

In this case SOMETHING can be terminated by the end of the string or up to the
first instance of a slash (/), question mark (?), or pipe (|). The pipe is a
special case and is removed during the replacement.

For example, if urls.REPLACE were set to 'oils://remote/replace':

url_prefix('REPLACE/stuff') becomes 'oils://remote/replace/stuff'
url_prefix('REPLACE?query') becomes 'oils://remote/replace?query'
url_prefix('RPLACE|ment') becomes 'oils://remote/replacement'

The pipe is intended for cases where the urls entry may or may not already
contain a query string, say for differences between OPACs where one requires
that something be passed into the query string, but the other uses a path
component instead.

New Operator Change Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The operator change dialog has a new dropdown allowing the selection of a
Temporary, Staff, or Permanent authtoken. The first option provides a temporary
operator change as has typically been done through this menu item. 'Staff' uses
a normal staff login authtoken for a multi-hour timeout. 'Permanent' is a staff
change that disregards the previous login instead of allowing it to be
recovered by using the menu item again.

Additional Work Log Entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Entries for bill payment and hold placement are now available in the 'Work Log'.

SIP
~~~

Support for credit card payment type and fine items details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support is now available to create a credit card payment type in the SIP Fee
Paid message. There is also now support for SIP clients to retrieve and
display a detailed/itemized list of billings to the patron.
