Record Buckets
==============

Introduction
------------

Record buckets are containers for MARC records. Once records are in a bucket, you can take
various types of actions, including:

* Editing all the records at once using the MARC Batch Editor.
* Deleting all the records in the bucket.
* Merging all the records in the bucket.
* Downloading the MARC files for all records in the bucket, so you can edit them in another
program like http://marcedit.reeset.net[MARCEdit].

Creating Record Buckets
-----------------------

. Click on _Cataloging_ -> _Record Buckets_.
. On the _Buckets_ menu, click _New Bucket_.
. Give the bucket a name and (optionally) a description.

which can be combined with one another.

|===================
|Search key           |Abbreviated version |Usage example               |Description
|author:              |au:                 |au:Anzaldua                 |An author, creator, or contributor
|available:           |                    |available:yes               |Limits to available items. There is no way to limit to _unavailable_ items
|keyword:             |kw:                 |kw:Schirmer                 |A keyword
|lang:                |                    |lang:Spanish                |A language
|series:              |se:                 |se:avatar last airbender    |A series title
|site:                |                    |site:LIB3                   |The shortname of the library/system/consortium you'd like to search
|subject:             |su:                 |su:open source software     |A subject
|subject\|geographic: |                    |subject\|geographic:Uruguay |A geographic subject
|title:               |ti:                 |ti:Harry Potter             |Title proper or alternate title
|title\|proper:       |                    |title\|proper:Harry Potter  |Title proper taken from 245
|===================

You can combine these in the same query, e.g. `ti:borderlands au:anzaldua available:yes`.  However -- with the exception of the _lang_ search key,
you should not repeat the same search key twice.

[TIP]
You can use the same boolean operator symbols that are used in the OPAC (_||_ for boolean OR, _&&_ for boolean AND, and _-_ for boolean NOT).
