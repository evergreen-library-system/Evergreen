Accessing the holdings editor from a catalog record
---------------------------------------------------

The bibliographic record detail page displays library holdings, including the call number, shelving location, and item barcode. Within the
staff client, the holdings list displays a column next to the item barcode(s) containing two links, *view* and *edit*.

Clicking on the *view* link opens the *Item Status* screen for that specific item.

Clicking on the *edit* link opens the *Holdings Editor* screen for that specific item.

The *edit* link will only be exposed next to copies when the user has the *UPDATE_COPY* permission at the copy owning or circulating library.
