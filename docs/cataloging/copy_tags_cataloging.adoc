Copy Tags
---------

Copy Tags allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags to items.  Copy tags are visible in the public catalog and are searchable in both the staff client and public catalog based on configuration.  This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to attach donation or memorial information to items, but may be used for broader purposes to tag items.

Copy tags can be created ahead of time in the Administration module (See the Administration section of this documentation for more information.) and then applied to items or they can be created on the fly during the cataloging process.

Adding Existing Copy Tags to Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy Tags can be added to existing items or to new items as they are cataloged.  To add a copy tag:

NOTE: It is not possible to remove tags using the Copy Bucket interface.

Searching Copy Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy Tags can be searched in the public catalog if searching has been enabled via Library Settings.  Copy Tags can be searched in the Basic and Advanced Search interfaces by selecting Digital Bookplate as the search field.  Specific copy tags can also be searched using a Keyword search and a specific search syntax.

Keyword Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Copy Tags can also be searched by using a Keyword search in the Basic and Advanced search interfaces.  Searches need to be constructed using the following syntax:


copy_tag(copy tag type code, search term)


For example:


copy_tag(bookplate, friends of the library)


It is also possible to conduct a wildcard search across all copy tag types:

copy_tag(*, smith)
