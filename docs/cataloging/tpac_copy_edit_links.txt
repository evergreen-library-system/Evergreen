TPAC Copy Edit Links
--------------------

The bibliographic record detail page displays library holdings, including the call number, shelving location, and copy barcode. Within the staff client, the holdings list now displays a new column next to the copy barcode(s). This new column contains two links, *view* and *edit*.

Clicking on the *view* link opens the *Item Status* screen for that specific copy.

Clicking on the *edit* link opens the *Volume and Copy Creator* screen for that specific copy.

The *edit* link will only be exposed next to copies when the user has the *UPDATE_COPY* permission at the copy owning or circulating library. 

For libraries where the *Library Setting: Unified Volume/Item Creator/Editor* value is set to *True*, the unified *Volume and Copy Creator* screen will open.

For libraries where the *Library Setting: Unified Volume/Item Creator/Editor* value is set to *False*, the standard *Volume and Copy Creator* screen will open.
