Monograph Parts
---------------

*Monograph Parts* enables you to differentiate between parts of monographs or other multi-part items.  This feature enables catalogers to describe items more precisely by labeling the parts of an item.  For example, catalogers might identify the parts of a monograph or the discs of a DVD set.  This feature also allows patrons more flexibility when placing holds on multi-part items.  A patron could place a hold on a specific disc of a DVD set if they want to access a specific season or episode rather than an entire series.

Four new permissions are used by this functionality: CREATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, UPDATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, DELETE_MONOGRAPH_PART and MAP_MONOGRAPH_PART.  These permissions should be assigned at the consortial level to those groups or users that will make use of the features described below.

Monograph Part Merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The monograph part list for a bibliographic record may, over time, diverge from
the proscribed format, resulting in multiple labels for what are essentially the
same item.  For instance, ++Vol.{nbsp}1++ may have variants
like ++V.1++, ++Vol{nbsp}1++, or ++{nbsp}Vol.{nbsp}1++ (leading
space). Merging parts will allow cataloging staff to collapse the variants into
one value.

In the Monograph Parts display:

. Click the checkbox for all items you wish to merge including the one you wish
to prevail when done.
. Click on the ``Merge Selected'' button. A pop-up window will list the selected
items in a monospaced font, with blanks represented by a middle-dot character
for more visibility.
. Click on the item you wish to prevail.

The undesired part labels will be deleted, and any copies that previously used
those labels will now use the prevailing label
