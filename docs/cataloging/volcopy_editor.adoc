The Holdings Editor is the tool where you can edit all holdings data.

Specific fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquisitions Cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
indexterm:[acquisitions cost]

This field is populated with the invoiced cost of the originating acquisition.
This field will be empty until its originating acquisition is connected to an
invoice.

Item Number
^^^^^^^^^^^
indexterm:[copy number]
indexterm:[item number]

If you have multiple copies of the same item, you may want to
assign them item numbers to help distinguish them.  If you do
not include an item number in this field, Evergreen will assign your
item a default item number of 1.
