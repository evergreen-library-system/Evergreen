Batch Importing MARC Records
----------------------------
[[batchimport]]
The cataloging module includes an enhanced MARC Batch Import interface for
loading MARC records. In general, it can handle batches up to 5,000 records
without a problem. This interface allows you to specify match points
between incoming and existing records, to specify MARC fields that should be
overlaid or preserved, and to only overlay records if the incoming record is
of higher quality than the existing record. Records are added to a queue where
you can apply filters that enable you to generate any errors that may have
occurred during import. You can print, email or export your queue as a CSV file.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

To use match sets to import records, you will need the following permission:

ADMIN_IMPORT_MATCH_SET


Record Display Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature enables you to specify the tags and subfields that will display in
records that appear in the import queue. 


[[matchsets]]
Record Match Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature enables you to create custom match points that you can use to
accurately match incoming records with existing catalog records.  
  
Creating a Match Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, to demonstrate matching on record attributes and MARC tags and
subfields, we will create a record match set that defines a match based on the
title of the record, in either the 240 or 245, and the fixed field, Lang.  You
can add multiple record attributes and MARC tags to customize a record match
set.
 

. Click *Cataloging -> MARC Batch Import/Export*.

. Create a new record match set.  Click *Record Match Sets -> New Match Set*.

. Enter a name for the record match set.

. Select an *Owning Library* from the drop down menu.  Staff with permissions
at this location will be able to use this record match set.

. Select a *Match Set Type* from the drop down menu.  You can create a match
set for authority records or bibliographic records.

. Click *Save*.
+

. The screen will refresh to list the record match set that you created. Click
the link to the record match set.

. Create an expression that will define the match points for the incoming
record.  You can choose from two areas to create a match: *Record Attribute* or
*MARC Tag and Subfield*.  You can use the Boolean operators AND and OR to
combine these elements to create a match set.

. Select a *Record Attribute* from the drop-down menu.

. Enter a *Match Score.*  The *Match Score* indicates the relative importance
of that match point as Evergreen evaluates an incoming record against an
existing record. You can enter any integer into this field.  The number that
you enter is only important as it relates to other match points.  Recommended
practice is that you create a match score of one (1) for the least important
match point and assign increasing match points to the power of 2 to working
points in increasing importance.

. Check the *Negate?* box if you want to negate the match point. Checking
this box would be the equivalent of applying a Boolean operator of NOT to the
match point.

. Click *Ok.*

. Drag the completed match point under the folder with the
appropriately-named Boolean folder under the Expression tree.
+

+
The match point will nest underneath the folder in the Expression tree.
+

. Enter another *Boolean Operator* to further refine your match set.

. Click *Boolean Operator*.

. Select the *OR* operator from the drop down menu.

. Click *Ok*.

. Drag the operator to the expression tree.
+
image::media/Batch_Importing_MARC_Records5.jpg[Batch_Importing_MARC_Records5]

. Click *MARC Tag and Subfield*.

. Enter a *MARC tag* on which you want the records to match.

. Enter a *subfield* on which you want the records to match.

. Enter a *Match Score.*  The *Match Score* indicates the relative importance
of that match point as Evergreen evaluates an incoming record against an
existing record. You can enter any integer into this field.  The number that
you enter is only important as it relates to other match points.  Recommended
practice is that you create a match score of one (1) for the least important
match point and assign increasing match points to the power of 2 to working
points in increasing importance.

. Check the *Negate?* box if you want to negate the match point.  Checking
this box would be the equivalent of applying a Boolean operator of NOT to the
match point.

. Click *Ok.*
+
image::media/Batch_Importing_MARC_Records6.jpg[Batch_Importing_MARC_Records6]

. Drag the completed match point under the folder with the
appropriately-named Boolean folder under the Expression tree. The Expression
will build across the top of the screen.

. Add additional MARC tags or record attributes to build the expression tree.

. Click *Save Changes to Expression*.

Replace Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replace Mode enables you to replace an existing part of the expression tree
with a new record attribute, MARC tag, or Boolean operator.  For example, if
the top of the tree is AND, in replace mode, you could change that to an OR.

. Create a working match point.

. Click *Enter replace mode*.

. Highlight the piece of the tree that you want to replace.

. Drag the replacement piece over the highlighted piece.

. Click *Exit Replace Mode*.


Quality Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Set the *Quality Metrics for this Match Set*.  Quality metrics are used to
determine the overall quality of a record.  Each metric is given a weight and
the total quality value for a record is equal to the sum of all metrics that
apply to that record.  For example, a record that has been cataloged thoroughly
and contains accurate data would be more valuable than one of poor quality. You
may want to ensure that the incoming record is of the same or better quality
than the record that currently exists in your catalog; otherwise, you may want
the match to fail.  The quality metric is optional.

. You can create quality metrics based on the record attribute or the MARC Tag
and Subfield.

. Click *Record Attribute.*

. Select an attribute from the drop down menu.

. Enter a value for the attribute.

. Enter a match score.  You can enter any integer into this field. The number
that you enter is only important as it relates to other quality values for the
current configuration.  Higher scores would indicate increasing quality of
incoming records. You can, as in the expression match score, increase the
quality points by increasing subsequent records by a power of 2 (two).

. Click *Ok*.

Import Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Import Records* interface incorporates record match sets, quality metrics,
more merging options, and improved ways to manage your queue.  In this example,
we will import a batch of records.  One of the records in the queue will
contain a matching record in the catalog that is of lower quality than the
incoming record.  We will import the record according to the guidelines set by
our record match set, quality metrics, and merge/overlay choices that we will
select.

. Select a *Record Type* from the drop down menu.

. Create a queue to which you can upload your records, or add you records to
an existing queue.  Queues are linked to match sets and a holdings import
profile. You cannot change a holdings import or record match set for a queue.

. Select a *Record Match Set* from the drop down menu.

. Select a *Holdings Import Profile* if you want to import holdings that are
attached to your records.

. Select a *Record Source* from the drop down menu.

. Select a *Merge Profile*.  Merge profiles enable you to specify which tags
should be removed or preserved in incoming records.

. Choose one of the following import options if you want to auto-import
records:

.. *Merge on Single Match* - Using the Record Match Set, Evergreen will only
attempt to perform the merge/overlay action if only one match was found in the
catalog.

.. *Merge on Best Match* - If more than one match is found in the catalog for a
given record, Evergreen will attempt to perform the merge/overlay action with
the best match as defined by the match score and quality metric.
+
NOTE: Quality ratio affects only the *Merge on Single Match* and *Merge on Best
Match* options.

. Enter a *Best/Single Match Minimum Quality Ratio.*  Divide the incoming
record quality score by the record quality score of the best match that might
exist in the catalog.  By default, Evergreen will assign any record a quality
score of 1 (one).  If you want to ensure that the inbound record is only
imported when it has a higher quality than the best match, then you must enter
a ratio that is higher than 1.  For example, if you want the incoming record to
have twice the quality of an existing record, then you should enter a 2 (two)
in this field.  If you want to bypass all quality restraints, enter a 0 (zero)
in this field.

. Select an *Insufficient Quality Fall-Through Profile* if desired.  This
field enables you to indicate that if the inbound record does not meet the
configured quality standards, then you may still import the record using an
alternate merge profile.  This field is typically used for selecting a merge
profile that allows the user to import holdings attached to a lower quality
record without replacing the existing (target) record with the incoming record.
This field is optional.  

. Under *Copy Import Actions*, choose _Auto-overlay In-process Acquisitions
Copies_ if you want to overlay temporary copies that were created by the
Acquisitions module.  The system will attempt to overlay copies that:

* have associated lineitem details (that is, they were created by the acquisitions process),
* that lineitem detail has the same owning_lib as the incoming copy's owning_lib, and
* the current copy associated with that lineitem detail is _In process_.

. *Browse* to find the appropriate file, and click *Upload*.  The files will
be uploaded to a queue.
+
image::media/marc_batch_import_acq_overlay.png[Batch Importing MARC Records]

. The screen will display records that have been uploaded to your queue.
+
image::media/Batch_Importing_MARC_Records15.jpg[Batch_Importing_MARC_Records15]

. If Evergreen indicates that matching records exist, then click the
*Matches* link to view the matching records.  Check the box adjacent to the
existing record that you want to merge with the incoming record. 
+
image::media/Batch_Importing_MARC_Records10.jpg[Batch_Importing_MARC_Records10]

. Click *Back to Import Queue*.

. Check the boxes of the records that you want to import, and click *Import
Selected Records*, or click *Import All Records*.

. A pop up window will offer you the same import choices that were present on
the *Import Records* screen.  You can choose one of the import options, or
click *Import*.
+
image::media/marc_batch_import_popup.png[Batch Importing MARC Records Popup]

. The screen will refresh.  The *Queue Summary* indicates that the record was
imported.  The *Import Time* column records the date that the record was
imported. Also, the *Imported As* column should now display the database ID (also known as the bib record number) for the imported record.
+
image::media/Batch_Importing_MARC_Records12.jpg[Batch_Importing_MARC_Records12] 

. You can confirm that the record was imported by using the value of the *Imported As* column by selecting the menu *Cataloging* -> *Retrieve title by database ID* and using the supplied *Imported As* number. Alternatively, you can search the catalog to confirm that the record was imported.

Default Values for Item Import 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen now supports additional functionality for importing items through *Cataloging* -> *MARC Batch Import/Export*.  When items are imported via a *Holdings Import Profile* in *Cataloging* -> *MARC Batch Import/Export*, Evergreen will create an item-level record for each copy.  If an item barcode, call number, copy location, or circulation modifier is not set in the embedded holdings, Evergreen will apply a default value based on the configured Library Settings.  A default prefix can be applied to the auto-generated call numbers and item barcodes.

The following *Library Settings* can be configured to apply these default values to imported items:

* *Vandelay: Generate Default Barcodes* —Auto-generate default item barcodes when no item barcode is present

* *Vandelay: Default Barcode Prefix* —Apply this prefix to any auto-generated item barcodes

* *Vandelay: Generate Default Call Numbers* —Auto-generate default item call numbers when no item call number is present

* *Vandelay: Default Call Number Prefix* —Apply this prefix to any auto-generated item call numbers

* *Vandelay: Default Copy Location* —Default copy location value for imported items

* *Vandelay: Default Circulation Modifier* —Default circulation modifier value for imported items

Importing Authority Records from the Staff Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an alternate method of importing authority records, read
<<_importing_authority_records_from_command_line,Importing Authority
Records from Command Line>>.

To import a set of MARC authority records from the _MARC Batch
Import/Export_ interface:

 . From the Evergreen staff client, select *Cataloging -> MARC Batch
Import/Export*. The _Evergreen MARC File Upload_ screen opens, with
_Import Records_ as the highlighted tab.

 . From the *Record Type* drop-down menu, select *Authority Records*.

 . Enter a name for the queue (batch import job) in the *Create a New
Upload Queue* field.

 . Select the *Import Non-Matching Records* checkbox.

 . Click the *Browse* button to select the file of MARC authorities to import.

 . Click the *Upload* button to begin importing the records.
+
The screen displays "Uploading... Processing..." to show that the records
are being transferred to the server, then displays a progress bar to show
the actual import progress. When the staff client displays the progress
bar, you can disconnect your staff client safely. Very large batches of
records might time out at this stage.

 . Once the import is finished, the staff client displays the results of
the import process. You can manually display the import progress by
selecting the _Inspect Queue_ tab of the _MARC Batch Import/Export_
interface and selecting the queue name. By default, the staff client does
not display records that were imported successfully; it only shows records
that conflicted with existing entries in the database. The screen shows
the overall status of the import process in the top right-hand corner,
with the Total and Imported number of records for the queue.
