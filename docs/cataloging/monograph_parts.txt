Monograph Parts
---------------

*Monograph Parts* enables you to differentiate between parts of monographs or other multi-part items.  This feature enables catalogers to describe items more precisely by labeling the parts of an item.  For example, catalogers might identify the parts of a monograph or the discs of a DVD set.  This feature also allows patrons more flexibility when placing holds on multi-part items.  A patron could place a hold on a specific disc of a DVD set if they want to access a specific season or episode rather than an entire series.

Four new permissions are used by this functionality: CREATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, UPDATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, DELETE_MONOGRAPH_PART and MAP_MONOGRAPH_PART.  Thes
e permissions should be assigned at the consorial level to those groups or users that will make use of the features described below.
