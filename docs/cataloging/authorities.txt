Managing Authorities
--------------------
This section describes how you can create, import, view, modify, merge, and delete authority records in Evergreen.

Creating Authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently in Evergreen to create a new authority record, as opposed to importing an authority record, you 
need to have a bib record open in the bib MARC editor. 

* For example, if you want to create a new author 
authority you need to have a bib record that has a bib 1xx or 7xx tag with the main entry filled out. 
* Then you need to right click on that 1xx or 7xx tag. In the context menu that shows up, select _Create 
New Authority from this field_, then select either _Create Immediately_ or _Create and Edit..._. 
* If you 
choose _Create and Edit..._, after the authority MARC editor opens you need to click on the _Save_ button
to finally add the new authority record to your system.


Importing Authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Click *Cataloging -> MARC Batch Import/Export.*
. You may create a queue to better track this import project.  If you do not create a new queue, it will automatically put your records into a default queue named *-*.
. Don't set a value for Holdings Import Profile, because this doesn't apply to authority records.
. Select a file of authority data and put it in the *File to Upload* field.
. Make sure all the settings are correct, then press *Upload.*
. Evergreen will automatically assign a thesaurus based on the *Subj* fixed field, which is character 11 in the 008 field.

[TIP]
=================
If you are importing authorities from an external vendor and want to track this, you may wish to set a unique Record Source.

Setting up Authority Record Match Sets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
. Click *Cataloging -> MARC Batch Import/Export.*
. Click *Record Match Sets.*
. If you have sufficient privileges, you will be able to click on the *New Match Set*.  If you are unable to do so, check that you have the ADMIN_IMPORT_MATCH_SET permission.
. Give your new set a descriptive name, an owning library, and a match set type of *authority.*
. Click on the blue hyperlinked name of the match set you just created to add criteria.
. You can match against MARC tag/subfield entries, against a record's normalized heading + thesaurus.

[TIP]
=================
Evergreen's internal identifier is in the 901c field. If you have previously exported authority record -- perhaps for an external vendor to do authority cleanup work -- and you want to import them back into your catalog, you may wish to include the 901c field in your match set.

Manage Authorities Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Evergreen to view, edit, merge, and delete authority records you would use the *Manage Authorities* interface 
through the *Cataloging* menu.



Searching for authorities
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To search for authorities in your system, first select the *Cataloging* menu and then select *Manage Authorities*. 
Then proceed to fill out the search form. 

. Type in your _Search Term_
. Select an _Authority type_, types currently include: Author, Subject, Title, Topic 
. Click on the _Submit_ button


The authority search results will include the following elements from left to right:

* _Actions_ menu, which can be used to select actions that affect the corresponding authority record. Actions include: 
_Edit_, _Mark for Merge_, _Delete_
* Count of how many bibs are linked to the corresponding authority
* Main entry of the authority, i.e the authority tag 1xx value
* _Control set_ value, with LoC being the default, but others can be added
* Authority Subject heading system/thesaurus, for example a value of "a" means authority originated from the Library of Congress 
 (http://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ad008.html)
