Release Notes for Evergreen 2.2.1
=================================

This release contains many bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.2.0.
Significant changes since 2.2.0 are mentioned below, roughly grouped by area
affected.  For more information on a given change, see the 
http://open-ils.org/downloads/ChangeLog-2.2.0-2.2.1[technical changelog].

All releases starting with this one are going to be much larger than they
used to be now that the Evergreen documentation is stored in the same
repository as the source code.  Cheers to Robert Soulliere and to so many
more contributors from our Documentation Interest Group.

We also have some new folks contributing code, as well as continuing
contributions from all the old folks (har).  Thanks all!
