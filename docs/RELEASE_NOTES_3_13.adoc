= Acquisitions =

== Angular interfaces for Invoices, Claims, MARC Federated Search, and Z39.50 Search ==

This work represents the last major part of the multi-year Angular Acquisitions project. The Invoices and Claims interfaces have been reimplemented in Angular and have had several improvements, including scoping claim policy actions; adding a summary to invoices recording funds and charges; integration with Acquisitions Search; and other bugfixes.

The MARC Federated search and Z39.50 search interfaces have also been reimplemented in Angular, including several bugfixes associated with Z39.50 search in particular.

A new component is also added for the MARC Batch Import/Export (Vandelay) and Load MARC Order Records interfaces that allows for background processing of record imports. There is a checkbox in each of these interfaces labeled _Request background import_ and a field to enter an email address. If a user selects background import, they can navigate away from the import screen while the import continues processing in the background. If they enter an email address, they will recieve a notification when the import is complete. Status and history of background imports for each user can be seen in the MARC Batch Import/Export interface under the new _Background Imports_ tab.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2039609[Bug 2039609]


== Fixes for SFTP Transfer of EDI Order Data ==

With more vendors requiring Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for sending and receiving acquisitions data via EDI, it was discovered that the SFTP mechanism in the Evergreen acquisitions module did not work as well as it should.

This release repairs the SFTP transfer mechanism so that it should work with most vendors who require usernames and passwords for authentication.

To switch from FTP to SFTP, edit the EDI account's host entry to begin with "sftp://" instead of "ftp://". Check with your EDI vendor before making this change. They may have additional requirements.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2040514[Bug 2040501]

=== New Prerequisite Perl Modules ===

This fix introduces two new required Perl modules for Evergreen: `Net::SFTP::Foreign` and `IO::Pty`. These can be installed by running the prerequisite installation for your Linux distribution. Please see the https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/install/README_3_12.html#_installing_prerequisites[Evergreen installation instructions].

== Acquisitions Miscellaneous ==

= Administration =

== Support Scripts: marc_export check for required IDs ==

The *marc_export* script will now exit if it expects to be passed IDs and they are not found. Previously it would continue on as if you wanted all records in the system in that situation. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1329872[Bug 1329872])

== Angular Circ Polices Editor and associated fixes ==

Angularized the Local Administration -> Circulation Policies interface, including several other bugfixes. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1855781[Bug 1855781])

== IDL Improvements and Clean Up ==

The IDL (`fm_IDL.xml`) has undergone improvement and clean up.

More fields have been marked required. Required fields are those that come from a database table, have a "NOT NULL" constraint in the schema, and do not have a default value assigned in the database.

This change has the advantage of making it easier for the Angular staff client to identify required fields and prevent bad data from being entered in many interfaces.

Classes that are read-only and virtual were ignored, since they cannot be updated. Virtual fields were also skipped for similar reasons.

No attempt was made to validate whether or not existing required fields should be required. If a field was required before these changes, it should still be required now.

Line wrap and spacing have been updated to match the output of libxml2.

Spaces used for indentation have been replaced with tabs using the vim and Emacs setting of 4 spaces per tab.

Two schema validation errors have been corrected:

 1. A typo of "relteype" was corrected to "reltype."

 2. An extra "retrieve" permissions entry was removed from the asc
 class.

If you have custom IDL entries, you will want to make sure that you merge with this update and check for conflicts. It would be a good idea to validate your merged IDL with the schema file:

----
xmllint --schema Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xsd Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xml
----

For maintaining future compatibility and ease of merging, you may want to ensure that your custom IDL entries follow the above formatting guidelines.

= Cataloging =

== New MARC Editor ==

Significant revision of the MARC rich editor. Instead of contextual menus, inputs for tags, indicators, and subfield codes use comboboxes. Subfield values use inputs or textareas, depending on the size of existing data or expected size based on the chosen subfield (e.g. 520 $a). Actions have individual buttons for better keyboard support.

Fields may be rearranged using drag and drop; the move button also supports up/down arrow key movement.

When navigating by keyboard, subfields are treated as a group. When a subfield group has focus, the right arrow key moves the cursor into the subfield code for editing and the tab key advances to the subfield value. An additional button to insert a new subfield appears; pressing Tab again moves focus to the next subfield group.

The rich editor now has a gray background based on user feedback regarding eyestrain with the white background in 3.6+. 

The Help button toggles the display of inline MARC references for fields 1xx-8xx as well as the keyboard shortcuts at the top. Fixed fields and control fields do not currently display inline help, but fixed field labels have tooltips to help users decipher the abbreviations.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2006969[Bug 2006969]

== Holdings Editor Batch Action &lt;None&gt; Option Restored ==

The &lt;None&gt; option has been restored for prefix and suffix fields in the Holdings Editor's Batch Actions. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1998413[Bug 1998413])

== Patron View Discovery Layer URL ==

A new org unit setting configures the discovery layer URL opened by the Patron View button on a staff catalog record. The placeholder to include for the record ID is {eg_record_id}.

Example: `https://example.com/Record/{eg_record_id}`

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2019207[Bug 2019207]

== Item Alerts Fixes ==

Fixes to editing item alerts, including the following (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2012971[Bug 2012971]):

* Fixes invocation of (Manage) Item Alerts dialog in Holdings Editor.
* Adds batch edit for Item Alerts in Holdings Editor. Alerts get grouped together for editing if they are mostly identical.
* Adds Manage Alerts button to Item Alerts dialog during alert display in Angular ("eg2") interfaces.
* Fixes TypeError: defaults is null exception for missing Default Item Alert Type preference.
* Adds a Changes Pending indicator for Holdings Editor. 

== Cataloging Miscellaneous ==

* Added read-only view for Holdings Editor if lacking an appropriately scoped UPDATE_COPY permission for all items being edited, including a mixed Permission dialog if the permission only covers some of the items being edited (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1932062[Bug 1932062]). Actions from the dialog: 
** Only show permissible items

= Client =

== Improve Button Colors in Staff Client ==

Yellow is no longer used as a button color in the staff client for normal actions such as closing dialogs that do not involve a condition that actually requires a warning.

Instead, light grey is used as a default color for buttons that do secondary actions, with a variant that includes red upon hover or activation for actions that remove data or clear form input.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2023803[Bug 2023803]

=== Developer Notes ===

The `btn-warning` CSS class should be avoided in the staff interface unless needed for actions that truly require a warning. Instead, `btn-normal` should be used for secondary actions such as closing a dialog and `btn-destroy` for actions that would remove or clear data.

== Library Group and Shelving Location Group search ==

A new dropdown is available when in-scope, including globally available, Library Groups are present. In-scope Shelving Location Groups can also optionally be presented in this dropdown. Scoping of Library Groups and Shelving Location Groups, in this interface component, is based on and effectively replaces the selected organizational unit, such that the Library Group or Shelving Location Group takes the place of a branch of the organizational hierarchy for location filtering.

When a Library Group or Shelving Location Group is selected from this new component, specific Shelving Location selection is disabled because those filtering axes are mutually exclusive.

=== Enabling and disabling Shelving Location Group inclusion ===

This development adds a new Global Flag called `staff.search.shelving_location_groups_with_lassos` ("Staff Catalog Search: Display shelving location groups with library groups"). If disabled, Shelving Location Groups will not be included in new filter dropdown. This is provided as a way to entirely separate Shelving Location Groups from this interface change in future parallel development, if desired, on an instance-by-instance basis.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1949109[Bug 1949109]

== Client Miscellaneous ==

== Creating carousels from item bucket or item status ==

The item status interface has a new option: "Create Carousel from Selected Items". The item bucket interface has a new option: "Create Carousel from Bucket". Both of these options allow users to create carousels, which can later be edited as needed in the Carousels Admin interface.

One use case for the new item bucket interface is to allow libraries to showcase existing item buckets that they have created for a holiday, program, or display.

= Reports =

== Angular Reporter rewrite ==

All existing Reporter interfaces, except for the actual report output, have been reimplemented using Angular to match the rest of the staff client. In addition to the updated and improved interfaces, additional functionality is now available:

* Field display order and output sort order are now separated, and can be controlled independently
* Nullability has been simplified, presenting the template creator with a choice between INNER join (linked required on both tables) and LEFT join (only the "parent" table is required to have a contributing row)
* Staff can see the list of Reports that make use of a Template, and the list of Outputs that are generated from a Report
* Where supported by the backend services, all Browse and Search grids used in the report management interfaces are sortable in ways other than by relevant timestamp, and many are now filterable using standard egGrid filters

Significant portions of the UI are inherited from the Simple Reporter implementation. Additionally, many existing UI elements have been enhanced to add supporting functionality, and any new functionality is available for use in other interfaces.

=== Existing templates ===

Care has been taken to allow existing templates to function properly in the new interface implementation. However, because the internal structure of the templates have changed, it is possible that some existing templates may need to be recreated.

= SIP =

== SIP2Mediator Support ==

Evergreen now supports back-end functionality to integrate with SIP2Mediator (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1901930[Bug 1901930]).

For more information, see the https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-admin:sip2mediator[Evergreen Wiki].

This work includes a SIP Filters tool which allows an administrator to choose to redact and/or overwrite the values in any SIP field with a field identifier. This was originally on https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1981712[Bug 1981712].

=== New Admin Interfaces ===

* Manage SIP accounts: Administration => Server Administration => SIP Accounts
* Manage SIP Screen Messages: Administration => Server Administration => SIP Screen Messages
* Manage SIP redactions and filters: Administration => Server Administration => SIP Filters
