== Upgrade notes ==

This release includes an import fix to values in the Coded Value Map 
table. Please refer to the "FIX DB Table config.coded_value_map"
section further down for important information on whether you need
to apply the fix and how to do so.

== New Features ==

:leveloffset: +2


= Acquisitions =


== EDI Attribute Added for Enumerating Lineitems Sequentially ==

Historically, Evergreen's EDI output has used the internal lineitem ID as the
line sequence number in LIN lines.  Some vendors (e.g. ULS) would prefer LIN to
use a sequentially assigned number instead.  A new EDI attribute, "Lineitems
Are Enumerated Sequentially," has been added to support that.  See
[LP 1949243](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1949243) for further
discussion.




= Administration =


== Add payment type to OPAC printed payment receipt Action Trigger definition ==

Adds correct payment type to the money.payment_receipt.print action trigger template, replacing the hard-coded "Credit Card".

An upgrade script is include which updates the money.payment_receipt.print action trigger template if it has not been altered from stock.


== IMPORTANT: FIX DB Table config.coded_value_map ==

If your Evergreen database pre-dates version 3.13 and you have executed the DB upgrade (1416) which was included in the Evergreen upgrade files:

* Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/version-upgrade/3.12.3-3.13.0-upgrade-db.sql
* Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/version-upgrade/1416.data.updated_marc_tag_tables.sql

As described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2073561[LP2073561]

You have two options:

. Use the provided fix SQL script to reset the tables to stock
. Use a backup database that you may have pre-3.13 upgrade, and restore these two tables:
.. config.coded_value_map
.. config.composite_attr_entry_definition
+
NOTE: You might prefer option 2 if you have customized the coded_value_map for new/different OPAC Icon/Search Formats.

=== Option 1: Reset the tables to stock

You will need to manually run the provided SQL file:

IMPORTANT: Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/LP2073561.fix.coded.value.map-post_3.13_upgrade.sql

Example:

[source,bash]
----
psql evergreen < Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/LP2073561.fix.coded.value.map-post_3.13_upgrade.sql
----

You may need additional options for the psql command depending on your environment.

=== Option 2: Restore from backup

. From the old copy of your database, pre-dating an upgrade to 3.13
+
[source,bash]
----
pg_dump evergreen --data-only --schema config \
--table config.coded_value_map \
--table config.composite_attr_entry_definition \
> ccvm_restore.sql
----
+
. Copy ccvm_restore.sql to an accessible location on your production database
+
[source,bash]
----
psql evergreen -c "truncate config.coded_value_map CASCADE;"
psql evergreen < ccvm_restore.sql
----

You may need additional options for the psql and pg_dump commands
depending on your environment.

IMPORTANT: We highly recommend testing these steps on a non-production database!


NOTE: If your Evergreen database started on version 3.13 and above, then you may ignore these instructions.



== Reporter Lock File Improvements ==

Changes in the location, name, and handling of the reporter's
(`clark-kent.pl`) lockfile may require adjustments in local management
scripts.

The lockfile's default location has been moved from
`/tmp/reporter-LOCK` to `LOCALSTATEDIR/run/reporter.pid`,
`/openils/var/run/reporter.pid` in a default configuration.  This
change allows it to fit in better with other Evergeen utilities that
use a similar location and name for their runtime files: SIPServer,
the MARC stream importer, etc.

If run as a daemon, the reporter now deletes the lockfile when the
main process exits.  This is not only good disk hygiene; the user or
administrator no longer has to manually delete the lockfile before
starting a new instance of the reporter.

Sites with scripts to start and stop the reporter may wish to review
them to determine if this update requires any changes to their
processes.


== Global Long-Lived Cache Clearing for Staff Client ==

A new global flag (staff.client_cache_key) has been added that allows
administrators to clear certain long-lived cache values from all staff clients
at next login by simply changing the value. Currently only the MARC Tag Tables
used by the bibliographic and authority record editors are cleared, but the
list of localStorage items cleared may be expanded in future. This key is
simply an opaque string - no special format is required - changing the value in
any way will trigger a wave of cache clearing.



= Architecture =


== Evergreen Supports PostgreSQL 17 ==

PostgreSQL 17 can be installed along with Evergreen using the normal
prerequisite installation process.



= Cataloging =


== Batch Edit Parts in the Holdings Editor ==

The holdings editor now has an option to batch edit bibliographic parts.




= Client =


== Table Density Setting ==

Evergreen staff users can now set their preferred density for
grids throughout the client.  The three options are: compact
(not much whitespace), Standard, and Wide (more whitespace).

To select a setting:

. Go to Administration -> Workstation.
. Select a value from the "Table Density" dropdown.
. Log out of the staff client and log back in to load the newly
  selected density setting.



= OPAC =


== Eresource link click tracking ==

This version of Evergreen introduces the ability
to track user clicks on eresources in the public
catalog.

This feature provides usage data on eresources in
the catalog.  One potential use for this feature
is to provide the equivalent of circulation
statistics for online course materials.

Data can be accessed via the Evergreen reporter.

=== Data collection

This feature does not collect any personally
identifiable data about the user who clicks
on the link.  The pieces of data that are
collected are:

* The URL clicked
* The time it was clicked
* The bibliographic record that contains the
URL.
* The ID, name, and number of any courses
that use the bibliographic record.

=== Enabling the feature

The new tables can grow forever, so before
enabling this feature:

* Ensure that you are monitoring disk space on
the server(s) that house your postgres database.
* Decide on a retention period for click data,
and set up the provided
``delete_old_eresource_link_clicks``
script to delete old data regularly.

To enable this feature:

. Set the
``opac.eresources.link_click_tracking``
global flag to true.
. Restart memcached and apache HTTP server.


=== Accuracy

Statistics from this feature are collected
on a best efforts basis, and have certain
limitations when it comes to accuracy:

* It does
not provide any guarantees against somebody
deliberately inflating the statistics of a
particular link, either through repeated network
calls or repeatedly clicking on a link they don't
actually intend to read.
* Clicks from certain very old, unsupported browsers
(notable Microsoft Internet Explorer) will
not be counted.
* Major bots are excluded, but uncommon bots and
bots that set a misleading User Agent header are
included unless they are blocked at the web server
or load balancer level.



### Library Group Item Counts in catalog

When a user selects a library group in the catalog (either the
public catalog or the staff catalog), the catalog now displays
the number of items held and available in that group.  This
information supplements the existing holding statements
available in the catalog.

If you have customized any of the following files, you will need
to update them to see the library group item counts.

* opac/parts/misc_util.tt2
* opac/parts/record/copy_counts.tt2
* opac/parts/result/copy_counts.tt2


== Move the OPAC alert banner to a library setting ==

Moves the Bootstrap OPAC maintenance message alert banner from the config.tt2 file to a trio of new library settings.

. OPAC Alert Banner: Display (true / false)
. OPAC Alert Banner: Text (the message that will appear)
. OPAC Alert Banner: Type (success, info, warning, danger)

The alert banner types utilize the existing CSS to determine the color scheme.

== Move Google Analytics configuration to library settings ==

Moves the Google Analytics configuration from the config.tt2 file
in the Bootstrap OPAC to two new library settings.

. Google Analytics: Enable (true/false)
. Google Analytics: Code (Analytics account code)

* A new `opensrf.xml` config file option, `honor_secondary_groups`, allows secondary group membership to add MFA configuration to a user, in addition to the main profile group. This option defaults to "false", i.e., secondary permission groups are not considered. If the option is turned on, if any permission group associated with the user, including the profile, requires MFA, MFA will be required of the user.
