Cloning Shared Templates
------------------------

indexterm:[reports, cloning]

This chapter describes how to make local copies of shared templates for routine 
reports or as a starting point for customization. When creating a new template 
it is a good idea to review the shared templates first: even if the exact 
template you need does not exist it is often faster to modify an existing 
template than to build a brand new one. A Local System Administrator account is 
required to clone templates from the _Shared Folders_ section and save them to _My 
Folders_.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one _Templates_ folder.  
If you havenâ€™t done this, please see <<reporter_creating_folders,Creating Folders>>.

. Access the reports interface from _Administration_ --> _Reports_
. Under _Shared Folders_ expand the _Templates_ folder and the subfolder of the 
report you wish to clone.  To expand the folders click on the grey arrow or 
folder icon.  Do not click on the blue underlined hyperlink.
. Click on the subfolder.
. Select the template you wish to clone.  From the dropdown menu choose _Clone 
selected templates_, then click _Submit_.

NOTE: By default Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view 
all content, change the Limit output setting from 10 to All.

. Choose the folder where you want to save the cloned template, then click 
_Select Folder_. Only template folders created with your account will be visible. 
If there are no folders to choose from please see 
<<reporter_creating_folders,Creating Folders>>.

. The cloned template opens in the template editor. From here you may modify 
the template by adding, removing, or editing fields and filters as described in 
<<reporter_creating_templates,Creating Templates>>. _Template Name_ and 
_Description_ can also be edited. When satisfied with your changes click _Save_.

. Click _OK_ in the resulting confirmation windows.

Once saved it is not possible to edit a template. To make changes, clone a 
template and change the clone.
