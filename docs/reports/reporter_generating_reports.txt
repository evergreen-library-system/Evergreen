Generating Reports from Templates
----------------------------------

indexterm:[reports, generating]

Now you are ready to run the report from the template you have created.

. In the My Folders section click the arrow next to _Templates_ to expand this 
folder and select _circulation_.

+
. Select the box beside _Circulations by month for one library_. Select _Create a 
new report_ from selected template from the dropdown menu. Click _Submit_. 
+

+
. Complete the first part of report settings. Only _Report Name_ and _Choose a 
folder_... are required fields.
+

+
1)  _Template Name_, _Template Creator_, and _Template Description_ are for 
informational purposes only. They are hard coded when the template is created. 
At the report definition stage it is not possible to change them.
+
2)  _Report Name_ is required. Reports stored in the same folder must have unique 
names.
+
3) _Report Description_ is optional but may help distinguish among similar 
reports.
+
4)  _Report Columns_ lists the columns that will appear in the output. This is 
derived from the template and cannot be changed during report definition.
+
5)  _Pivot Label Column_ and _Pivot Data Column_ are optional. Pivot tables are a 
different way to view data. If you currently use pivot tables in MS Excel it is 
better to select an Excel output and continue using pivot tables in Excel.
+
6)  You must choose a report folder to store this report definition. Only report 
folders under My Folders are available. Click on the desired folder to select it.
+
. Select values for the _Circulation > Check Out Date/Time_. Use the calendar 
widget or manually enter the desired dates, then click Add to include the date 
on the list. You may add multiple dates.
+

+
The Transform for this field is Year + Month, so even if you choose a specific 
date (2009-10-20) it will appear as the corresponding month only (2009-10).
+
It is possible to select *relative dates*. If you select a relative date 1 month 
ago you can schedule reports to automatically run each month. If you want to run 
monthly reports that also show comparative data from one year ago, select a 
relative date 1 month ago, and 13 months ago.
+
. Select a value for the _Circulating Library_.
. Complete the bottom portion of the report definition interface, then click 
_Save_.
+

+
1) Select one or more output formats. In this example the report output will be 
available as an Excel spreadsheet, an HTML table (for display in the staff 
client or browser), and as a bar chart.
+
2) If you want the report to be recurring, check the box and select the 
_Recurrence Interval_ as described in <<recurring_reports,Recurring Reports>>.  
In this example, as this is a report that will only be run once, the _Recurring 
Report_ box is not checked.
+
3) Select _Run_ as soon as possible for immediate output. It is also possible to 
set up reports that run automatically at future intervals.
+
4) It is optional to fill out an email address where a completion notice can be 
sent. The email will contain a link to password-protected report output (staff 
login required). If you have an email address in your Local System Administrator 
account it will automatically appear in the email notification box.  However, 
you can enter a different email address or multiple addresses separated by commas.
+
. Select a folder for the report's output.
. You will get a confirmation dialogue box that the Action Succeeded. Click _OK_.

Once saved, reports stay there forever unless you delete them.

Viewing and Editing Report Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New options to view or edit report parameters are available from the reports folder.

To view the parameters of a report, select the report that you want to view from the *Reports* folder, and click *View*.  This will enable you to view the report, inlcuding links to external documentation and field hints.  However, you cannot make any changes to the report.

To edit the parameters of a report, select the report that you want to view from the *Reports* folder, and click *Edit*.  After making changes, you can *Save [the] Report* or *Save as New*.  If you *Save the Report*, any subsequent report outputs that are generated from this report will reflect the changes that you have made.

In addition, whenever there is a pending (scheduled, but not yet started) report output, the interface will warn you that the pending output will be modified.  At that point, you can either continue or choose the alternate *Save as New* option, leaving the report output untouched.

If, after making changes, you select, *Save as New*, then you have created a new report by cloning and ammending a previously existing report. Note that if you create a new report, you will be prompted to rename the new report. Evergreen does not allow two reports with the same name to exist. To view or edit your new report,  select the reports folder to which you saved it.
