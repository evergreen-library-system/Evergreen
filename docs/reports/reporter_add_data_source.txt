Adding Data Sources to Reporter
-------------------------------

indexterm:[reports, adding data sources]

You can further customize your Evergreen reporting environment by adding 
additional data sources.

The Evergreen reporter module does not build and execute SQL queries directly, 
but instead uses a data abstraction layer called *Fieldmapper* to mediate queries 
on the Evergreen database.Fieldmapper is also used by other core Evergreen DAO 
services, including cstore and permacrud. The configuration file _fm_IDL.xml_ 
contains the mapping between _Fieldmapper_ class definitions and the database. 
The _fm_IDL.xml_ file is located in the _/openils/conf_ directory.

indexterm:[fm_IDL.xml]

There are 3 basic steps to adding a new data source. Each step will be discussed 
in more detail in the

. Create a PostgreSQL query, view, or table that will provide the data for your 
data source.
. Add a new class to _fm_IDL.xml_ for your data source.
. Restart the affected services to see the new data source in Reporter.

There are two possbile sources for new data sources:

indexterm:[PostgreSQL]

indexterm:[SQL]

* An SQL query built directly into the class definition in _fm_IDL.xml_. You can 
use this method if you are only going to access this data source through the 
Evergreen reporter and/or cstore code that you write.
* A new table or view in the Evergreen PostgresSQL database on which a class 
definition in _fm_IDL.xml_. You can use this method if you want to be able to 
access this data source through directly through SQL or using other reporting tool.

Create a PostgreSQL query, view, or table for your data source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[PostgreSQL]

You need to decide whether you will create your data source as a query, a view, 
or a table.

. Create a query if you are planning to access this data source only through the 
Evergreen reporter and/or cstore code that you write. You will use this query to 
create an IDL only view.
. Create a view if you are planning to access this data source through other 
methods in addition to the Evergreen reporter, or if you may need to do 
performance tuning to optimize your query.
. You may also need to use an additional table as part of your data source if 
you have additional data that's not included in the base Evergreen, or if you 
need to use a table to store the results of a query for performance reasons.

To develop and test queries, views, and tables, you will need

* Access to the Evergree PostgreSQL database at the command line. This is 
normally the psql application. You 
can access the Postgres documentation at the 
http://http://www.postgresql.org/docs/[Official Postgres documentation] for 
more information about PostgreSQL.
* Knowledge of the Evergreen database structure for the data that you want to 
access. You can find this information by looking at the Evergreen schema
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/schema/[Evergreen schema] 

indexterm:[database schema]

If the views that you are creating are purely local in usage and are not intended 
for contribution to the core Evergreen code, create the Views and Tables in the 
extend_reporter schema. This schema is intended to be used for local 
customizations and will not be modified during upgrades to the Evergreen system.

You should make that you have an appropriate version control pocess for the SQL 
used to create you data sources.

Here's an example of a view created to incorporate some locally defined user 
statistical categories:

.example view for reports
----------
create view extend_reporter.patronstats as
select u.id, 
grp.name as "ptype",
rl.stat_cat_entry as "reg_lib",
gr.stat_cat_entry as "gender",
ag.stat_cat_entry as "age_group",
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(u.dob)) as "age",
hl.id as "home_lib",
u.create_date,
u.expire_date,
ms_balance_owed
from actor.usr u
join permission.grp_tree grp 
    on (u.profile = grp.id and (grp.parent = 2 or grp.name = 'patron')) 
join actor.org_unit hl on (u.home_ou = hl.id)
left join money.open_usr_summary ms 
    on (ms.usr = u.id) 
left join actor.stat_cat_entry_usr_map rl 
    on (u.id = rl.target_usr and rl.stat_cat = 4) 
left join actor.stat_cat_entry_usr_map bt 
    on (u.id = bt.target_usr and bt.stat_cat = 3) 
left join actor.stat_cat_entry_usr_map gr 
    on (u.id = gr.target_usr and gr.stat_cat = 2) 
left join actor.stat_cat_entry_usr_map gr 
    on (u.id = gr.target_usr and gr.stat_cat = 2) 
left join actor.stat_cat_entry_usr_map ag 
    on (u.id = ag.target_usr and ag.stat_cat = 1) 
where u.active = 't' and u.deleted <> 't';

Add a new class to fm_IDL.xml for your data source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your data source, the next step is to add that data source as a 
new class in _fm_IDL.xml_.

indexterm:[fm_IDL.xml]
indexterm:[fieldmapper]
indexterm:[report sources]

You will need to add the following attributes for the class definition:

* *id*. You should follow a consistent naming convention for your class names 
that won't create conflicts in the future with any standard classes added in 
future upgrades. Evergreen normally names each class with the first letter of 
each word in the schema and table names. You may want to add a local prefix or 
suffix to your local class names.
* *controller=”open-ils.cstore”*
* *oils_obj:fieldmapper=”extend_reporter::long_name_of_view”*
* *oils_persist.readonly=”true”*
* *reporter:core=”true”* (if you want this to show up as a “core” reporting source)
* *reporter:label*. This is the name that will appear on the data source list in 
the Evergreen reporter.
* *oils_persist:source_definition*. If this is an IDL-only view, add the SQL query 
here. You don't need this attribute if your class is based on a PostgreSQL view 
or table.
* *oils_persist:tablename="schemaname.viewname or tablename"* If this class is 
based on a PostgreSQL view or table, add the table name here. You don't need 
this attribute is your class is an IDL-only view.

For each column in the view or query output, add field element and set the 
following attributes. The fields should be wrapped with _<field> </field>_:

* *reporter:label*. This is the name that appears in the Evergreen reporter.
* *name*. This should match the column name in the view or query output.
* *reporter:datatype* (which can be id, bool, money, org_unit, int, number, 
interval, float, text, timestamp, or link)

For each linking field, add a link element with the following attributes. The 
elements should be wrapped with _<link> </link>_:

* *field* (should match field.name)
* *reltype* (“has_a”, “might_have”, or “has_many”)
* *map* (“”)
* *key* (name of the linking field in the foreign table)
* *class* (ID of the IDL class of the table that is to be linked to)

The following example is a class definition for the example view that was created 
in the previous section.

.example class definition for reports
----------
<class id="erpstats" controller="open-ils.reporter-store" 
oils_obj:fieldmapper="extend_reporter::patronstats" 
oils_persist:tablename="extend_reporter.patronstats" oils_persist:readonly="true" 
reporter:label="Patron Statistics" reporter:core="true">
  <fields oils_persist:primary="id">
  <field reporter:label="Patron ID" name="id" reporter:datatype="link" />
  <field reporter:label="Patron Type" name="ptype" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Reg Lib" name="reg_lib" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Boro/Twp" name="boro_twp" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Gender" name="gender" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Age Group" name="age_group" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Age" name="age" reporter:datatype="int" />
  <field reporter:label="Home Lib ID" name="home_lib_id" 
    reporter:datatype="link" />
  <field reporter:label="Home Lib Code" name="home_lib_code" 
    reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Home Lib" name="home_lib" reporter:datatype="text" />
  <field reporter:label="Create Date" name="create_date" 
    reporter:datatype="timestamp" />
  <field reporter:label="Expire Date" name="expire_date" 
    reporter:datatype="timestamp" />
  <field reporter:label="Balance Owed" name="balance_owed" 
    reporter:datatype="money" />
</fields>
<links>
  <link field="id" reltype="has_a" key="id" map="" class="au"/>
  <link field="home_lib_id" reltype="has_a" key="id" map="" class="aou"/>
</links>
</class>

NOTE: _fm_IDL.xml_ is used by other core Evergreen DAO services, including cstore 
and permacrud. So changes to this file can affect the entire Evergreen 
application, not just reporter. After making changes fm_IDL.xml, it is a good 
idea to ensure that it is valid XML by using a utility such as *xmllint* – a 
syntax error can render much of Evergreen nonfunctional. Set up a good change 
control system for any changes to fm_IDL.xml. You will need to keep a separate 
copy of you local class definitions so that you can reapply the changes to 
_fm_IDL.xml_ after Evergreen upgrades.

Restart the affected services to see the new data source in the reporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are needed to for Evergreen to recognize the changes to 
_fm_IDL.xml_

. Copy the updated _fm_IDL.xml_ into place:
+
-------------
cp fm_IDL.xml /openils/conf/.
-------------
+
. (Optional) Make the reporter version of fm_IDL.xml match the core version.
Evergreen systems supporting only one interface language will normally find
that _/openils/var/web/reports/fm_IDL.xml_ is a symbolic link pointing to
_/openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml_, so no action will be required. However, systems
supporting multiple interfaces will have a different version of _fm_IDL.xml_ in
the _/openils/var/web/reports_ directory. The _right_ way to update this is to
go through the Evergreen internationalization build process to create the
entity form of _fm_IDL.xml_ and the updated _fm_IDL.dtd_ files for each
supported language. However, that is outside the scope of this document. If you
can accept the reporter interface supporting only one language, then you can
simply copy your updated version of _fm_IDL.xml_ into the
_/openils/var/web/reports_ directory:
+
-------------
cp /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml /openils/var/web/reports/.
-------------
+
. As the *opensrf* user, run Autogen to to update the Javascript versions of
the fieldmapper definitions.
+
-------------
/openils/bin/autogen.sh
-------------
+    
. As the *opensrf* user, restart Perl services:
+
-------------
osrf_ctl.sh -l -a restart_perl
-------------
+    
. As the *opensrf* user, restart C services:
+
-------------
osrf_ctl.sh -l -a restart_c
-------------
+
. As the *root* user, restart the Apache web server:
+
-------------
service apache2 restart
-------------
+
. As the *opensrf* user, restart the Evergreen reporter. You may need to modify
this command depending on your system configuration and PID path:
+
------------
opensrf-perl.pl -l -action restart -service open-ils.reporter \
-config /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml -pid-dir /openils/var/run
------------
+
. Restart the Evergreen staff client, or use *Admin --> For Developers -->
