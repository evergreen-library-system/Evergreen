Starting and Stopping the Reporter Daemon
-----------------------------------------

indexterm:[reports, starting server application]

indexterm:[reporter, starting daemon]

Before you can view reports, the Evergreen administrator must start 
the reporter daemon from the command line of the Evergreen server.

The reporter daemon periodically checks for requests for new reports or 
scheduled reports and gets them running.

Starting the Reporter Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[reporter, starting]

To start the reporter daemon, run the following command as the opensrf user:

----
clark-kent.pl --daemon
----

You can also specify other options:

* *sleep=interval*: number of seconds to sleep between checks for new reports to 
run; defaults to 10
* *lockfile=filename*: where to place the lockfile for the process; defaults to 
/tmp/reporter-LOCK
* *concurrency=integer*: number of reporter daemon processes to run; defaults to 
1
* *boostrap=filename*: OpenSRF bootstrap configuration file; defaults to 
/openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml


[NOTE]
=============
The open-ils.reporter process must be running and enabled on the gateway before 
the reporter daemon can be started.

Remember that if the server is restarted, the reporter daemon will need to be 
restarted before you can view reports unless you have configured your server to 
start the daemonautomatically at start up time. 
==============

Stopping the Reporter Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[reports, stopping server application]

indexterm:[reporter, stopping daemon]

To stop the reporter daemon, you have to kill the process and remove the 
lockfile. Assuming you're running just a single process and that the 
lockfile is in the default location, perform the following commands as the 
opensrf user:

----
kill `ps wax | grep "Clark Kent" | grep -v grep | cut -b1-6`

rm /tmp/reporter-LOCK
----
