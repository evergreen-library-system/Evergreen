== Evergreen 3.12.4 ==

This release contains bug fixes improving on Evergreen 3.12.3.

This includes fixes for a critical-importance security issue and two high-importance security issues. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

=== Upgrade notes ===

The security patches for https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2069959[Bug 2069959] and https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2019157[Bug 2019157]
both involve changes to OPAC Template Toolkit templates.  If you
have customized these templates, perhaps as branding for a specific
org unit, please review your customized version to ensure that:

=== Architecture ===

* IDL Improvements and Clean Up *
https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2050227[Bug 2050227]

The IDL (fm_IDL.xml) has undergone improvement and clean up.

More fields have been marked required. Required fields are that those that come from a database table, have a "NOT NULL" constraint in the schema, and do not have a default value assigned in the database. This change has the advantage of making it easier for the Angular staff client to identify required fields and prevent bad data from being entered in many interfaces.

Classes that are read-only and virtual were ignored, since they cannot be updated. Virtual fields were also skipped for similar reasons.

No attempt was made to validate whether or not existing required fields should be required.  If a field was required before these changes, it should still be required now.

Line wrap and spacing have been updated to match the output of libxml2.

Spaces used for indentation have been replaced with tabs using the vim and Emacs setting of 4 spaces per tab.

Two schema validation errors have been corrected:

. A typo of "relteype" was corrected to "reltype."
. An extra "retrieve" permissions entry was removed from the asc class.

If you have custom IDL entries, you will want to make sure that you merge with this update and check for conflicts.  It would be a good idea to validate your merged IDL with the schema file:

----
xmllint --schema Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xsd Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xml
----

For maintaining future compatibility and ease of merging, you may want to ensure that your custom IDL entries follow the above formatting guidelines.

== Upgrade notes ==

=== AutoRenew Event Definition default delay ===

Upgrade script required for change in AutoRenew Event Definition default delay

=== Removal of OpenSRF Legacy JSON Gateway ===

The OpenSRF Legacy JSON Gateway is deprecated and will been removed from OpenSRF.  This
requires removing any references to it in the Apache configuration.

This means removing references to "OSRFGatewayLegacyJSON" in 
/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf.

Example patch:

== Interface for Fiscal Years and Calendars ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1956510[Bug 1956510]

A new interface is now available for users to manage fiscal years and calendars . It is accessible via Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Fiscal Years and Calendars.

To add or edit fiscal calendars and years, a user must have the ADMIN_ACQ_FISCAL_YEAR permission.

Org units by default use the 'Default' fiscal calendar. If new fiscal calendars are created and users wish their associated fiscal years to be visible in the 'Year' drop down of other interfaces, the Fiscal Calendar must be updated to use the new fiscal calendar in the org unit.


= Administration =


== Optional Evergreen "Authoritative" API Support ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2012402[Bug 2012402]

Previous versions of Evergreen supported "authoritative" API calls by default.
These are API calls which force database reads to go the primary database
instead of a pooled replica.

Going forward, this functionality will be disabled by default, but may be
enabled via a new opensrf.xml setting.

If your site uses database pooling, with Evergreen actively reading from
replicas, add this setting to your opensrf.xml file within the <default/>
block:

[source,xml]
----
<opensrf version='0.0.3'>
  <default>
    <uses_pooled_read_replica_dbs>true</uses_pooled_read_replica_dbs>
<!-- ... -->
----




== Change in AutoRenew Event Definition Default Delay ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1899976[Bug 1899976]

The delay for the AutoRenew event has been changed from -23 hours to
-24 hours and 1 minute.  The previous values of -23 hours for the
delay and -1 minute for the max_delay left a gap of approximately 1
hour where items would not auto-renew if they fell due during that
time.  Depending upon the time that the AutoRenew event runner is
scheduled to run, this gap may never turn up.  However, all it takes
is a misconfigured client (i.e. an incorrect timezone setting) or a
manually edited due date on a circulation for this to turn up.  The
new interval settings guarantee that all circulations for a given 24
hour period are selected with no gap.

A database upgrade script is provided to alter any event definitions
using the `Circ::Autorenew` reactor and the previous default delay
values to the new settings.  If you have customized or added any event
definitions using this reactor, you should double check that they are
correct after an upgrade.




== Hatch Print Config Angular Port ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1965326[Bug 1965326]

The Hatch printer settings interface has been ported to Angular.

The checkbox to enable Hatch printing has also been moved from the 
separate (now-retired) "Print Service (Hatch)" interface into the newly 
Angularized "Hatch (Print Service) Printer Settings" interface.


== Shelving Locations Editor: Hide deleted shelving locations by default ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1917092[Bug 1917092]

In the Shelving Locations Editor under Local Administration, a filter to hide 
deleted locations is applied by default. Clicking the Remove Filters button or 
Clearing the filter on the Is Deleted column will reveal the deleted locations.

== Hostname URL building ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1862834[Bug 1862834]

Fixed issue loading some AngularJS interfaces when hostname starts with *staff* or *eg*


== marc_export script improvments ==

=== --852 option for marc_export ===

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2041364[Bug 2041364]

The new `--852b` switch (when used in conjunction with `--items`)
takes the following values:

 * circ_lib - emit the item circulation library in 852$b
 * owning_lib - emit the owning library in 852$b
 * both - emit owning lib and circ lib as separate repeats
   of $b. This is both the default and legacy behavior.

[source]
----
 --852b             Accepts 'owning_lib', 'circ_lib', or 'both' to
                    control whether the 852 in exported embedded
                    holdings has the owning library, the circulation
                    library, or both in separate repeats of the .
                    If not supplied, defaults to 'both', which is the
                    legacy behavior.
----



=== --exclude-hidden option for marc_export ===

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2015484[Bug 2015484]

The `--exclude-hidden` option, when used in conjunction with
`--items`, will not emit 852 fields for items if they are hidden
from in the OPAC in any of the four ways that this can be
specified in Evergreen. If a bib therefore ends up with no
visible items, it will be excluded from the output.

[source]
----
 --exclude-hidden   Exclude records and items if the item is not
                    OPAC-visible per its org unit, status, shelving,
                    location, or flag on the item record. This option
                    is effective only if the --library and/or --items
                    flags are supplied. This option takes precedence;
                    for example, if the org unit specified by --library
                    is not OPAC-visible, its records will not be included
                    in the export.
----



=== marc_export sorting bib output ===

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2029256[Bug #2029256]

The *marc_export* script will now sort the bib record output
by the bib record ID so that the records in the export file
are in a consistant order. 



=== marc_export default encoding changed to UTF-8 ===

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2015758[Bug #2015758]

The default file encoding output when using the *marc_export* script is
now *UTF-8* instead of *MARC8*.  After upgrading check your use of the
*marc_export* script to ensure that if you need an encoding other than 
*UTF-8* you specify it with the argument *--encoding*.  This change has
the possiblity of breaking your workflow. 

== Custom Org Unit Trees interface ported to Angular ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1993825[Bug 1993825]

Reimplemented the Admin Custom Org Unit trees interface in Angular.

== Upgrading to Evergreen/OpenSRF Redis ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2041431[Bug 2041431], https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2017941[Bug 2017941]

Some of these steps are part of a standard install, included here
for completeness.

NOTE: Most of these steps are done automatically when installing OpenSRF and 
Evergreen from scratch.  It may be easier for some (and less error 
prone) to install new servers than to upgrade existing ones.


=== Assumptions ===

* Evergreen/OpenSRF are installed in the default /openils directory.
* Assumes a single machine 'localhost' install.

=== Install ===

* From within the dowload / checkout directory
* ${OSNAME} might be, for example, 'ubuntu-jammy'

==== Install Prerequisites ====

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo make -f OpenSRF/src/extras/Makefile.install ${OSNAME}
sudo make -f Evergreen/Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install ${OSNAME}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Install Opensrf & Evergreen ====

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd OpenSRF
make clean all
sudo make install

# ----

cd ../Evergreen
make clean all
sudo make install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Configure ===

==== configure opensrf_core.xml ====

===== Create a local redis-accounts.txt file =====

Redis passwords are generated at install time and stored in 
'redis-accounts.txt.example'.  Make a local copy to retain our passwords.
The defaults will be locally generated, unique, and safe to use.

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd /openils/conf
cp redis-accounts.txt.example redis-accounts.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== Copy Redis passwords into opensrf_core.xml =====

Passwords are defined for 'opensrf', 'router', and 'gateway'.

Example redis-accounts.txt entry for the 'opensrf' account:

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACL SETUSER opensrf reset
ACL SETUSER opensrf on >1f129912-b38a-4c42-910f-521e0651b7b9
ACL SETUSER opensrf -@all +lpop +blpop +rpush +del ~opensrf:router:* ~opensrf:service:* ~opensrf:client:*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'opensrf' account password for the example above is
'1f129912-b38a-4c42-910f-521e0651b7b9'.  Copy this value into opensrf_core.xml

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <domain>private.localhost</domain>                                         
    <username>opensrf</username>                                               
    <passwd>1f129912-b38a-4c42-910f-521e0651b7b9</passwd> 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeat this process for the 'router' and 'gateway' accounts.  There will
be one password entry for 'gateway' and 2 password entries for 'router'.

===== Update Gateway Username =====

Going forward, the username for the <gateway/> section will be 'gateway'.

Example:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <gateway>
    ...
    <username>gateway</username>
    <passwd>a9080f2e-3504-4d38-9179-8e3d06c53bfd</passwd>
    <port>6379</port>
    <loglevel>3</loglevel>
    ...
  </gateway>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== Update the Port =====

Update occurrences of port '5222' (i.e. your local ejabberd port) with
the default Redis port '6379'. There will be 4 occurrences by default.

Example:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <domain>private.localhost</domain>
    <username>opensrf</username>
    <passwd>1f129912-b38a-4c42-910f-521e0651b7b9</passwd>
    <port>6379</port>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Update /etc/hosts ====

To avoid requiring Redis listen on multiple IP addresses, change the
'public' and 'private' hosts in /etc/hosts to use the same IP.

[source,sh]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
127.0.0.1 localhost public.localhost private.localhost
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Configure Redis ====

Disable message persistence by modifying the Redis 'save' setting.

* Open `/etc/redis/redis.conf` and make the following                            
** Apply a save value of ""
** Disable existing definitions for the 'save' value.

[source, bash]                                                                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
# Snapshotting can be completely disabled with a single empty string argument  
# as in following example:                                                     
#                                                                              
save ""                                                                        

# save 900 1
# save 300 10
# save 60 10000
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
                                                                              
Restart the Redis server to make the changes take effect:                   
                                                                              
[source,sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
sudo systemctl restart redis-server                                                   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    

==== Restart Everything ====

[source,sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
osrf_control -l --restart-all
sudo systemctl restart apache2 nginx websocketd-osrf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    

*Done!*

=== Upgrade Note: Removal of OpenSRF Legacy JSON Gateway ===

The OpenSRF Legacy JSON Gateway is deprecated and will been removed from OpenSRF.  This
requires removing any references to it in the Apache configuration.

This means removing references to "OSRFGatewayLegacyJSON" in 
/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf.

== Create MARC Record Interface Enhancements ==


* Add a global keyboard shortcut for Create MARC Record of Ctrl+F3. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031040[Bug 2031040])

* Focus on the template selector on load, and set unique page title for interface. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031043[Bug 2031043])

* Focus on item add checkbox and switch to call number input after activation. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031114[Bug 2031114])

* Hide the help button when the flat text editor is enabled since it doesn't do anything in that mode. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031123[Bug 2031123])

* Add keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+s) to save in the flat text editor. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031162[Bug 2031162])

* Add shortcut key (Ctrl+E) to jump to the flat text editor textbox. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2031177[Bug 2031177])

== Default Item Alert Type ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2017673[Bug 2017673]

Staff can now set a default item alert type for new item
alerts.  To do this:

. Open the holdings editor
. Select the Preferences tab.  
. Under the "Item Attribute Settings" heading, use the
"Default Item Alert Type" dropdown to choose the type
that you use most frequently.
. The setting takes effect immediately, no need to save
it.



== Added Content Tab in Staff Catalog ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1991294[Bug 1991294]

Adds an Added Content tab to the record details page in the angular staff catalog.

 *  The new Added Content tab currently supports only NoveList Select added content.
 *  NoveList Select subscribers will need to request credentials specifying the staff client url from NoveList for the library settings, separate from the credentials used in the OPAC.

=== Added Content Library Settings ===

The following Library Settings control the behavior of the Added Content tab

  * Staff Client added content: NoveList Select API version (not required)
  * Staff Client added content: NoveList Select profile/user (
  * Staff Client added content: NoveList Select key/password
  * URL Override for NoveList Select added content javascript (not required)

The following new permission controls the ability to setting the URL Override library setting

  * UPDATE_ADDED_CONTENT_URL
  

=== Added Content Tab Behavior ===

  * If no NoveList settings are present for the OU level, the Added Content tab does not appear.
  * If NoveList is set up but the bib record lacks ISBNs, or there is no NoveList content available for the work, the tab appears but it will say "No Added Content" and its star will be empty and gray.
  * If NoveList is set up and content is available, the tab's star will be gold and filled in. It may take a few seconds to change when you first load the record. It will load in the background while you are viewing any other tab in the record.

== Link Checker ported to Angular ==

== Expansion of Copy Statuses Eligible to Fill Holds ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1904737[Bug 1904737]

Copies with a status that has both the `holdable` and `is_available`
fields set to `true` are now elibible to fill holds.  This was
previously limited to copies with a "magical" status of 0 or 7.  The
change expands the copies that can fill holds and affords better
control over what copies with what statuses will appear on the holds
pull list or target holds.


== Add filters to Holds Pull List ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1968070[Bug 1968070]

Two new filter comboboxes have been added to the Holds Pull List, one to filter by Pickup Library
and one to filter by Shelving Locations / Shelving Location Groups. The Print Full List and
Download CSV actions respect the new filters, which will improve usability for libraries with
large pull lists who need to split the list into sections for multiple staff to work on. The
settings are also sticky, which will make it easier for individuals who always work on pulling
holds in the same section of the library every day.

== Google Analytics 4 Update ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2019972[Bug 2019972]

Google is transitioning from Universal Analytics
to GA4 during the Summer of 2023, which requires
an update to the Javascript that is embedded in the 
public catalog pages. 

Note that Google requires each site to set up a
new unique code (G-) that replaces the old
(UA-) code and this will also need to be updated in
config.tt2.

== New Setting for Default URI Notes ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1812241[Bug 1812241]

If a URI does not have a 856$z defining a note to display next to
it in the OPAC you can use the opac.uri_default_note_text setting
to define one.

This feature helps to save catalogers time.  If your library has
a note that should be added to a wide range of electronic resources,
rather than applying the note to all applicable records, you can set
this setting to an appropriate value, and add an 856$z note for any
resources that shouldn't receive the default note.


== Improve OPAC URI link purpose display and coverage ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1992827[Bug 1992827]

Previously, the logic used in the OPAC and staff client to display
non-located URIs was slightly different. In particular, the staff client
included any 856 with an ind2 value of 0, 1, or 2, and provided a label
indicating the purpose of the URI based on the ind2 value. The OPAC, on
the other hand, only displayed 856s with an ind2 of 0 or 1, and did
not distinguish the purpose.

Now the OPAC displays non-located URIs in the same ways as the staff
client, including those with an ind2 value of 2 and displaying a
descriptive purpose with the link.

== Editing manual carousels via the original bucket ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1920234[Bug 1920234]

Creating a carousel from a bucket no longer creates a new "System-created bucket".  When
a new carousel is generated from a record bucket, any changes made to the bucket will be
automatically reflected in the carousel. Staff no longer need to go to the Carousels
Administration screen to make these changes.

This change only affects newly created carousels.  Existing manual carousels will still

== Course Reserve Search Filter ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1895699[Bug 1895699]

This filter allows users to limit their search to records that are
    attached to courses at particular libraries, like so:
    
        biology on_reserve(5, 10)
    
The filter can also be negated to search for records that are not
attached to a course:
    
        biology -on_reserve(5)

If an organization is opted into the Course Materials module, this
filter will appear on the search results page of the public catalog.
Staff at these organizations will have a new option in their
staff catalog search preferences to enable this filter in the staff
catalog as well.


== Display Upcoming Closures in OPAC ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2017913[Bug 2017913]

the Closed Dates Editor) to the library information
pages in the OPAC.


= Reports =


== Reporting Sources for Invoice Totals ==

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2036842[Bug 2036842]

Three new reporting sources are available to permit reporting
on the total amount of invoices, including both line items and
direct charges. The sources are:

  * Invoice Totals
  * Invoice Debits by Fund
  * Invoice Debits by Fund Tag

These sources are meant to be used as the base source of a report,
with any additional fields and tables of interest brought via
navigating links in the template editor.


= Miscellaneous =

* Barcode transfered to new copy in volume editor in Angular interface for fast item add (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1986706[Bug 1986706])

* Adds a new database view for open non-cataloged circulations: action.open_non_cataloged_circulation (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2019974[Bug 2019974])
* Reimplementation of Cataloging -> Link Checker in Angular. Changed a few things hopefully for the better:
** Relabeled URL Verification Attempts to Batches
** Relabeled URL Verifications to Attempts
** Main grid display combines Sessions and Batches.
* New Angular linting rules (https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1850473[Bug 1850473])
