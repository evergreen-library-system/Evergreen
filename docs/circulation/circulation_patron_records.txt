Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Abstract*

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.  

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

. Patrons will see a confirmation message: “Registration successful!  Please see library staff to complete your registration.”

image::media/patron_self_registration2.JPG[Patron Self-Registration form]

*Managing Pending Patrons*

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Select the patron you would like to review.  In this screen you have the option to *Delete* a pending patron account or *Load* the pending patron information to create a permanent library account.

. To create a permanent library account for the patron, click on the patron’s row, right-click and select *Load Patron* or click on the *Load Patron* button at the top of the screen.  This will load the patron self-registration information into the main *Patron Registration* form. 

. Fill in the necessary patron information for your library, and click *Save* to create the permanent patron account.



*Library Settings*

Three new Library Settings have been created to manage patron self-registration:

* *OPAC: Allow Patron Self-Registration* must be set to ‘True’ to enable use of this feature.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Expire Interval* allows each library to set the amount of time after which pending patron accounts should be deleted.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Display Timeout* allows each library to set the amount of time after which the patron self-registration screen will timeout in the OPAC.  The default is 5 minutes.

Several existing Library Settings can be used to determine if a field should be required or hidden in the self-registration form:

* *GUI: Require day_phone field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show day_phone on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require dob (date of birth) field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show dob field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require State field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show State field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require county field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show county field on patron registration*  [New Setting]

Several existing Library Settings can be used to verify values in certain fields and provide examples for data format on the registration form:

* *Global: Patron username format*

* *GUI: Regex for phone fields on patron registration* OR *GUI: Regex for day_phone field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Regex for email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Regex for post_code field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for post_code field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for day_phone field on patron registration* OR *GUI: Example for phone fields on patron registration*



[[updating_patron_information]] 
Updating Patron Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, updating]

Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>.

Select _Edit_ from the options that display at the top of the patron record. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-9.png[circulation_patron_records 9]

Edit information as required.  When finished, select _Save_.  If you attempt to
close out of the patron account before the information is received, an alert
will display.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-10.png[circulation_patron_records 10]

Select _OK_ to continue or _Cancel_ to return to the editing form.

After selecting _Save_, the page will refresh.  The edited information will be
reflected in the patron summary pane.

NOTE: If collapsed, you will need to manually ``un-collapse'' this pane. 

Renewing Library Cards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[library cards, renewing]

Expired patron accounts display with a black box around the patron’s name, a
note that the patron is expired, and – when initially retrieved – an alert
stating that the ``Patron account is EXPIRED.''

image::media/circulation_patron_records-11.png[circulation_patron_records 11]

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Navigate to the information field labeled _Privilege Expiration Date_.  Enter a
new date in this box.  When you place your cursor in the _Patron Expiration Date
box_, a calendar widget will display to help you easily navigate to the desired
date. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-12.png[circulation_patron_records 12]

Select the date using the calendar widget or key the date in manually.  Click
the _Save_ button.  The screen will refresh and the ``expired'' alerts on the
account will be removed. 

Lost Library Cards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[library cards, replacing]

Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.
 
Next to the _Barcode_ field, select the _Replace Barcode_ button.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-13.png[circulation_patron_records 13]

This will clear the barcode field.  Enter a new barcode and _Save_ the record.
The screen will refresh and the new barcode will display in the patron summary
pane.  

If a patron’s barcode is mistakenly replaced, the old barcode may be reinstated.
Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. Open the patron record in
edit mode as described in the section <<updating_patron_information,Updating
Patron Information>>.

Select the _See All_ button next to the _Replace Barcode_ button.  This will
display the current and past barcodes associated with this account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-14.png[circulation_patron_records 14]

Check the box(es) for all barcodes that should be ``active'' for the patron.  An
``active'' barcode may be used for circulation transactions.  A patron may have
more than one ``active'' barcode.  Only one barcode may be designated
``primary.'' The ``primary'' barcode displays in the patron’s summary
information in the _Library Card_ field. 

Once you have modified the patron barcode(s), _Save_ the patron record.  If you
modified the ``primary'' barcode, the new primary barcode will display in the
patron summary screen. 

Resetting Patron's Password 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, passwords]

A patron’s password may be reset from the OPAC or through the staff client.  To
reset the password from the staff client, retrieve the patron record as
described in the section <<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Select the _Reset Password_ button next to the _Password_ field.  

image::media/circulation_patron_records-15.png[circulation_patron_records 15]

NOTE: The existing password is not displayed in patron records for security
reasons.

A new number will populate the _Password_ and _Verify Password_ text boxes.
Make note of the new password and _Save_ the patron record.  The screen will
refresh and the new password will be suppressed from view.   

[TIP]

If you need to change a patron or staff account password without using the staff client, here is how you can reset it with SQL.

Connect to your Evergreen database using psql or a similar tool, and retreive and verify your admin username:

psql -U <user-name> -h <hostname> -d <database>

SELECT id, usrname, passwd from actor.usr where usrname = 'admin';

If you do not remember the username that you set, search for it in the actor.usr table, and then reset the password.

UPDATE actor.usr SET passwd = <password> WHERE id=<id of row to be updated>;

The new password will automatically be hashed. 


Barring a Patron 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

A patron may be barred from circulation activities.  To bar a patron, retrieve
the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Check the box for _Barred_ in the patron account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-16.png[circulation_patron_records 16]

_Save_ the user.  The screen will refresh.  

The patron account will now display an alert stating that the patron account 
is *BARRED*.  

Additionally a red box and note will indicate the patron’s barred status. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-17.png[circulation_patron_records 17]

NOTE: Barring a patron from one library bars that patron from all consortium
member libraries. 

To unbar a patron, uncheck the Barred checkbox.

Barred vs. Blocked 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

*Barred*: Stops patrons from using their library cards; alerts the staff that
the patron is banned/barred from the library. The ``check-out'' functionality is
disabled for barred patrons (NO option to override – the checkout window is
unusable and the bar must be removed from the account before the patron is able
to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds fine threshold 
* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.

Patron Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, Alerts]
    
When an account has an alert on it, a Stop sign is displayed when the record is
retrieved.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-18.png[circulation_patron_records 18]

Navigating to an area of the patron record using the navigation buttons at the
top of the record (for example, Edit or Bills) will clear the message from view.

If you wish to view these alerts after they are cleared from view, they may be
retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-19.png[circulation_patron_records 19]

There are two types of Patron Alerts:

*System-generated alerts*: Once the cause is resolved (e.g. patron's account has
been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Enter the alert text in the Alert Message field.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-20.png[circulation_patron_records 20]

_Save_ the record. The screen will refresh and the alert will display.

Additionally, the patron name will be highlighted in yellow and a note will
indicate that there is an alert on the account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-21.png[circulation_patron_records 21]

To remove the alert, retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Delete the alert text in the _Alert Message_ field. 

_Save_ the record.  

The screen will refresh and the indicators for the alert will be removed from 
the account. 

Patron Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, notes]

When a patron account contains a note, a _See Notes_ message appears beneath the
patron’s name in the patron summary pane. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-22.png[circulation_patron_records 22]

Notes are strictly communicative and may be made visible to the patron via their
account on the OPAC.  In the JSPAC, these notes display on the account summary
screen in the OPAC.

Disable Patron Credit in Billing Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Library Setting, *Disable Patron Credit*, allows staff to disable the Patron Credit payment type and to hide patron credit payment actions within the billing interface of a patron’s account. 

By default, the payment type *Patron Credit* is enabled in the staff client. Within the Bills interface of a patron’s account, the Patron Credit payment type, the Credit Available, and the option to Convert Change to Patron Credit are exposed by default in the staff client. 

image::media/Default_Patron_Billing_Screen.jpg[Default Patron Billing Screen]

When the Library Setting, *Disable Patron Credit*, is set to *True*, the patron credit payment type will be disabled. Patron Credit will not be an option within the payment type dropdown menu. The Convert Change to Patron Credit and the summary of Credit Available will be hidden from the patron billing interface in the staff client. 

image::media/Disabled_Patron_Credit_Patron_Billing_Screen.jpg[Disabled Patron Credit Patron Billing Screen]

NOTE: After applying changes to this library setting, it is necessary to restart the staff client to see the changes take effect.  


Lost and Long Overdue Bill Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This stylization enhancement distinguishes Lost and Long Overdue circulations that appear within the billed transactions of a patron’s account from other items that are still checked out.  

Within the patron’s list of billed transactions, Lost or Long Overdue items, which have not yet been returned, display differently from other items that are still checked out. The color distinctions are applied to the entire row of the billed transaction (previous to version 2.5, only the title of the billed transaction was highlighted). These color enhancements are accompanied by helpful indicators that define the meaning of the colors for staff.  

By default, Lost circulations will appear in dark red. The default indicator reads, “Dark Red Items are Lost.”  

When the 6 Month Overdue Mark Long-Overdue trigger event definition is enabled, Long Overdue circulations will appear in orange, by default. The default indicator reads, “Orange Items are Long Overdue.”  
 
image::media/Billed_Transaction_Color.JPG[Billed Transaction Color]
 
Both the color distinctions and indicators are customizable. To customize, a change to circ.css (for the color) and lang.dtd (for the indicator) are required.
