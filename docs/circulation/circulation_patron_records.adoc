To search for a patron, select the Patron Search option from the toolbar,
_Search -> Search for Patrons_ from the menu bar, or *F4*.

The Patron Search screen will display.  The orientation of the search pane may
be vertical or horizontal, depending on your library’s configuration.  It will
contain options to search on the following fields:

* Last Name 
* First Name 
* Middle Name 
* Alias 
* Address 1 
* Address 2 
* City 
* Zip 
* Phone
* Email

.Tips for searching 
[TIP] 
=================== 
* Search one field or combine fields for more precise results.  
* Truncate search terms for more search results.
===================

Once you have located the desired patron, highlight the entry for this patron in
the results screen.  A summary for this patron will display in place of the
search fields.  

image::media/circulation_patron_records-2.png[circulation_patron_records 2]

Use the _Retrieve Patron_ button to retrieve the patron for circulation or
editing.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-3.png[circulation_patron_records 3]

The _Search Form_ button may be used to resume searching for patrons.

Registering New Patrons 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, registering]

To register a new patron, select _Patron Registration_ from the toolbar,
_Circulation -> Register Patron_ from the menu bar, or *shift + F1*. The Patron
Registration form will display. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-4.png[Patron registration form]

Mandatory fields display in yellow.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-5.png[circulation_patron_records 5]

The _Show Only Required Fields_ and _Show Suggested Fields_ may be used to limit
the options on this page.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-6.png[circulation_patron_records 6]

When one of these options is selected, it is possible switch to the other
limited view or to revert to the original view by selecting _Show All Fields_. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-7.png[circulation_patron_records 7]

When finished entering the necessary information, select _Save_ to save the new
patron record or _Save & Clone_ to register a patron with the same address.
When _Save & Clone_ is selected, the address information is copied into the
resulting patron registration screen.  It is linked to the original patron.
Address information may only be edited through the original record.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-8.png[circulation_patron_records 8]

[TIP]
============================================================================
* Requested fields may be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_ (_Admin ->
 Local Admin -> Library Settings Editor_).  
* Statistical categories may be created for information tracked by your library 
that is not in the default patron record.  
* These may be configured in the _Statistical Categories Editor_ (_Admin -> 
Local Admin -> Statistical Categories Editor_).  
* Staff accounts may also function as patron accounts.
* You must select a _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ before the _Update Expire
Date_ button will work, since the permission group determines the expiration date.
============================================================================

New Patron Duplicate Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a new patron is being registered Evergreen checks some of the information entered against existing patrons to catch duplicate registrations.

The fields that are checked are patron name (_First Name_ and _Last Name_), _Email_, _Daytime Phone_, _Evening Phone_, and _Other Phone_.  Both active and inactive patrons are checked.

When a match is found a link will appear indicating how many duplicate patrons there are and what information they match on.

image::media/patron-reg-duplicate-search-1.png[patron registration]

To view the duplicate matches click on the link.  This performs a patron search in a new tab.

WARNING: This search only includes inactive patrons if the _Include inactive patrons?_ check box is checked.

Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Abstract*

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.  

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

. Patrons will see a confirmation message: “Registration successful!  Please see library staff to complete your registration.”

image::media/patron_self_registration2.jpg[Patron Self-Registration form]

*Managing Pending Patrons*

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Select the patron you would like to review.  In this screen you have the option to *Delete* a pending patron account or *Load* the pending patron information to create a permanent library account.

. To create a permanent library account for the patron, click on the patron’s row, right-click and select *Load Patron* or click on the *Load Patron* button at the top of the screen.  This will load the patron self-registration information into the main *Patron Registration* form. 

. Fill in the necessary patron information for your library, and click *Save* to create the permanent patron account.



*Library Settings*

Three new Library Settings have been created to manage patron self-registration:

* *OPAC: Allow Patron Self-Registration* must be set to ‘True’ to enable use of this feature.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Expire Interval* allows each library to set the amount of time after which pending patron accounts should be deleted.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Display Timeout* allows each library to set the amount of time after which the patron self-registration screen will timeout in the OPAC.  The default is 5 minutes.

Several existing Library Settings can be used to determine if a field should be required or hidden in the self-registration form:

* *GUI: Require day_phone field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show day_phone on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require dob (date of birth) field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show dob field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require State field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show State field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require county field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show county field on patron registration*  [New Setting]

Several existing Library Settings can be used to verify values in certain fields and provide examples for data format on the registration form:

* *Global: Patron username format*

* *GUI: Regex for phone fields on patron registration* OR *GUI: Regex for day_phone field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Regex for email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Regex for post_code field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for email field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for post_code field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Example for day_phone field on patron registration* OR *GUI: Example for phone fields on patron registration*

Renewing Library Cards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[library cards, renewing]

Expired patron accounts display with a black box around the patron’s name, a
note that the patron is expired, and – when initially retrieved – an alert
stating that the ``Patron account is EXPIRED.''

Barring a Patron 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

A patron may be barred from circulation activities.  To bar a patron, retrieve
the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Check the box for _Barred_ in the patron account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-16.png[circulation_patron_records 16]

_Save_ the user.  The screen will refresh.  

The patron account will now display an alert stating that the patron account 
is *BARRED*.  

Additionally a red box and note will indicate the patron’s barred status. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-17.png[circulation_patron_records 17]

NOTE: Barring a patron from one library bars that patron from all consortium
member libraries. 

To unbar a patron, uncheck the Barred checkbox.

Barred vs. Blocked 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

*Barred*: Stops patrons from using their library cards; alerts the staff that
the patron is banned/barred from the library. The ``check-out'' functionality is
disabled for barred patrons (NO option to override – the checkout window is
unusable and the bar must be removed from the account before the patron is able
to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds fine threshold 
* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.


Staff-Generated Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_messages]]
indexterm:[patrons, messages]

There are several types of messages available for staff to leave notes on patron records.

*Patron Notes*: These notes are added via _Other_ -> _Notes_ in the patron record, and create a clickable (See Notes) message beneath the patron name on the patron record screen. These notes can be viewable by staff only or shared with the patron. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> for more.)

*Patron Alerts*: This type of alert is added via _Edit_ button in the patron record. It creates a non-blocking alert message which displays when the patron is retrieved. It also creates a clickable (Alert) message beneath the patron name on the patron record screen. There is currently no way to require staff initials for this type of alert. (See the section <<circulation_patron_alerts,Patron Alerts>> for more.)

*Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages*: These messages are added via the _Messages_ button in the patron record. They can be a note, alert or block. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<staff_generated_penalties,Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages>> for more.)

*Patron Message Center*: The Patron Message Center provides a way for libraries to communicate with patrons through messages that can be accessed through the patron's OPAC account.  Library staff can create messages manually by adding an OPAC visible Patron Note to an account.  Messages can also be automatically generated through an Action Trigger event.  Patrons can access and manage messages within their OPAC account.  (See the section <<patron_message_center>> for more.)

Patron Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_alerts]]
indexterm:[patrons, Alerts]
    
When an account has an alert on it, a Stop sign is displayed when the record is
retrieved.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-18.png[circulation_patron_records 18]

Navigating to an area of the patron record using the navigation buttons at the
top of the record (for example, Edit or Bills) will clear the message from view.

If you wish to view these alerts after they are cleared from view, they may be
retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-19.png[circulation_patron_records 19]

There are two types of Patron Alerts:

*System-generated alerts*: Once the cause is resolved (e.g. patron's account has
been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Enter the alert text in the Alert Message field.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-20.png[circulation_patron_records 20]

_Save_ the record. The screen will refresh and the alert will display.

Additionally, the patron name will be highlighted in yellow and a note will
indicate that there is an alert on the account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-21.png[circulation_patron_records 21]

To remove the alert, retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Delete the alert text in the _Alert Message_ field. 

_Save_ the record.  

The screen will refresh and the indicators for the alert will be removed from 
the account. 

Patron Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_notes]]
indexterm:[patrons, notes]

When a patron account contains a note, a _See Notes_ message appears beneath the
patron’s name in the patron summary pane. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-22.png[circulation_patron_records 22]

Notes are strictly communicative and may be made visible to the patron via their
account on the OPAC. These notes appear in the <<_patron_message_center,

Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_penalties]]
To access this feature, use the _Messages_ button in the patron record.

image::media/staff-penalties-1.jpg[Messages screen]

Add a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click *Apply Standing Penalty/Message* to begin the process of adding a message to the patron.

image::media/staff-penalties-2.jpg[Apply Penalty Dialog Box]

There are three options: Notes, Alerts, Blocks

* *Note*: This will create a non-blocking, non-alerting note visible to staff. Staff will be alerted to the message by the light-blue framing around the patron name, and can view the message by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record.  (Notes created in this fashion will not display via _Other_ -> _Notes_, and cannot be shared with the patron. See the <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> section for notes which can be shared with the patron.)

* *Alert*: This will create a non-blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved.  The alert will generate a dark-blue frame around the patron name. Alerts may be viewed by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record or by selecting _Other_ -> _Display Alerts and Messages_.

* *Block*: This will create a blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved, and which behaves much as the non-blocking alert described previously. The patron will be also blocked from circulation, holds and renewals until the block is cleared by staff.

After selecting the type of message to create, enter the message body into the box. If Staff Initials are required, they must be entered into the _Initials_ box before the message can be added.  Otherwise, fill in the optional _Initials_ box and click *Apply*

The message should now be visible in the _Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages_ list. If a blocking or non-blocking alert, the message will also display immediately when the patron record is retrieved.

image::media/staff-penalties-3.jpg[Messages on a record]

Modify a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages can be edited by staff after they are created. 

image::media/staff-penalties-4.jpg[Actions menu]

Click to select the message to be modified, then click _Actions for these Penalties/Messages_ -> _Modify Penalty/Message_. This menu can also be accessed by right-clicking in the message area.

Patron Message Center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[patron_message_center]]

Creating a Patron Message in the Patron Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Retrieve a patron account in the staff client.
. Within the account, go to *Other -> Notes*.
. In the Notes interface, click on *Add New Note*.  A new window will pop up that allows you to create a note on the patron account.
+
image::media/message_center1.PNG[Message Center 1]
+
. Check the box next to *Patron Visible?*  This will make the message appear in the patron's OPAC account.
. Enter a subject for the message in the *Title* field.
. Enter the body of the message in the *Note* field.

+
image::media/message_center2.PNG[Message Center 2]
+
. The patron visible note will also create a message in the patron account in the staff client in *Other -> Message Center*.  See *Managing Patron Messages in the Staff Client* below.

Creating a Patron Message using Action Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages can be automatically added to a patron's OPAC account by an Action Trigger event.  For example, when a hold is cancelled by a library staff member, a message can be added to the patron's OPAC account to inform them of the cancellation.

Action Trigger Messages are set up in *Admin -> Local Administration -> Notifications/Action Triggers*.  There are several new fields in the Trigger Event Definition that allow the configuration of Patron Messages:

* Message Library Path: identifies the sending library for the message.  This is the patron's home library (usr.home_ou) in the stock Hold Cancellation message.
* Message Template: contains the content of the message.
* Message Title: appears as the subject line in the OPAC message.
* Message User Path: determines how to identify the user the message is sent to.

NOTE: If you want to send patrons a notification email and an OPAC message when their hold is cancelled, use two separate Action Triggers: one for the email notification and one for the message.

Managing Patron Messages in the Staff Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patron messages can be viewed and managed in the staff client within the patron account.

. Retrieve a patron account in the staff client.
. Within the account, go to *Other -> Message Center*.
. Double click on a message to view the full title and content as well as the date and time the message was created and the date and time that the message was read.  Staff can also see if a patron has deleted the message from their OPAC account (Deleted?) and can manually delete a message by marking it as Deleted.

NOTE: When a message is marked deleted, the message will remain in Other -> Message Center as a record that the patron received it.

NOTE: Deleting a patron visible note in Other -> Notes will not delete the patron message from the Other -> Message Center.

image::media/message_center9.PNG[Message Center 9]

Viewing Patron Messages in the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patrons will see a new tab for *Messages* in their OPAC account, as well as a notification of *Unread Messages* in the account summary.

image::media/message_center11.PNG[Message Center 11]

Patrons will see a list of the messages from the library by clicking on the *Messages* tab.

image::media/message_center10.PNG[Message Center 10]

Patrons can click on a message *Subject* to view the message.  After viewing the message, it will automatically be marked as read.  Patrons have the options to mark the message as unread and to delete the message.

image::media/message_center12.PNG[Message Center 12]

NOTE: Patron deleted messages will still appear in the patron's account in the staff client under Other -> Message Center.

Merging Patron Records 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[bills_and_payments]] 
Bills and Payments 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a patron account has bills attached to it, a note displays under the patron
name in the patron summary panel.  

image::media/circulation_patron_bills-1.png[circulation_patron_bills 1]

To view more information about the patron’s bills, or to make payments on or
edit the bills, click on the Bills button from the patron account screen. 

image::media/circulation_patron_bills-2.png[circulation_patron_bills 2]

The Bills Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All current bills are itemized in the grid in the bills interface. Click on a 
column header to sort bills in this grid. Most columns sort alphabetically, but 
the "Total Billed" and *Total Paid* columns sort numerically.

Colors distinguish bills for items that are attached to checked out, lost and
long overdue circulations. These colors are accompanied by helpful indicators
that define the meaning of the colors for staff.  

By default, circulations that are still checked out appear in bright red. The
default indicator reads, "Red Items are still Checked out.

Lost circulations will appear in dark red. The default indicator reads,
“Dark Red Items are Lost.”  

When the 6 Month Overdue Mark Long-Overdue trigger event definition is enabled,
Long Overdue circulations will appear in orange, by default. The default
indicator reads, “Orange Items are Long Overdue.”  
 
image::media/Billed_Transaction_Color.jpg[Billed Transaction Color]
 
Both the color distinctions and indicators are customizable. To customize, a
change to circ.css (for the color) and lang.dtd (for the indicator) are
required.


[[circ_vs_grocery]] 
*Circulation bills*: system-generated (overdue fines, lost
item cost, processing fees, etc.).

* Overdue fines are added daily once an item is overdue.
* When an item is marked as lost or long overdue, bills may be automatically
generated to cover the item's cost and a processing fee, according to library
policy.

*Grocery bills*: staff-applied to patron accounts.

Making Payments 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To collect payments, retrieve the patron record.  Navigate to the _Bills_ screen
as described in <<bills_and_payments,Bills and Payments>>.

When bills are paid, the money applied starts at the top of the list of bills.
To pay specific bills, uncheck the bills that you do not wish to pay at this
time. The amount displayed in _Total Checked:_ will change to reflect the
appropriate amount.

image::media/circulation_patron_bills-6.png[circulation_patron_bills 6]

[TIP]
By default, Evergreen checks all bills when the bills screen loads. 
Evergreen sites can change this default by enabling the _Uncheck bills by
default in the patron billing interface_ setting in the Library Settings
Editor (*Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor*). Note
the presence of the _Uncheck All_ and _Check All_ options below the list of
bills.

image::media/circulation_patron_bills-7.png[circulation_patron_bills 7]

When you are ready to make a payment, select a payment type from the dropdown
menu in the _Pay Bill_ portion of the screen.

image::media/circulation_patron_bills-8.png[circulation_patron_bills 8]

Enter the amount of payment in the _Payment received_ field.  

If you would like to add a note to the payment, check the box for 
_Annotate Payment_.  

Click _Apply Payment!_ to make the payment.  

If you have selected _Annotate Payment_, a box will display for the annotation.  

The screen will refresh to display the updated bill information for the patron.
If change is due, the bottom portion of the screen, _Change Due Upon Payment:_
will briefly reflect the amount due to the patron.  

TIP: if you need more time to review the amount due, click outside the _Payment
Received_ box before selecting _Apply Payment!_ This will cause the screen to
refresh and display the amount due.

[TIP] 
================================================ 
* Items marked with red are still checked out. Items marked with dark red are
lost. Items marked with orange are still checked out and long overdue.
* It is possible for a patron to pay a bill while the item is still out and
accruing fines. 
* When Check is selected as the payment type, it is not necessary to select
_Annotate Payment_, as a box for the check number and a note displays
automatically.
* If a patron pays the entire bill for a lost item and the library has enabled
the _Use Lost and Paid copy status_ setting in the Library Settings Editor
(*Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor*), the copy's 
status will automatically change from _Lost_ to _Lost and Paid_.
================================================

Patron Credits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to convert change due to a patron credit by selecting the
_Convert Change to Patron Credit_ checkbox and to later apply that credit to a
bill by selecting the _Patron Credit_ payment type.

By default, the payment type *Patron Credit* is enabled in the staff client.
Within the Bills interface of a patron’s account, the Patron Credit payment
type, the Credit Available, and the option to Convert Change to Patron Credit
are exposed by default in the staff client. 

image::media/Default_Patron_Billing_Screen.jpg[Default Patron Billing Screen]

The Library Setting, *Disable Patron Credit*, allows staff to disable the Patron
Credit payment type and to hide patron credit payment actions within the billing
interface of a patron’s account. If a library doesn't use patron credits, the
library will want to enable this setting to prevent accidental selection of the
checkbox that converts change to patron credit.

When the Library Setting, *Disable Patron Credit*, is set to *True*,
the patron credit payment type will be disabled.
Patron Credit will not be an option within the payment type dropdown menu.
The Convert Change to Patron Credit and the summary of Credit Available will be
hidden from the patron billing interface in the staff client. 

image::media/Disabled_Patron_Credit_Patron_Billing_Screen.jpg[Disabled Patron Credit Patron Billing Screen]

To set the Library Setting:

. Click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor*

. Search for *Disable Patron Credit*

. Click *Edit*

. Set the value to *True*

. Click *Update Setting*

image::media/Disable_Patron_Credit_Library_Setting.jpg[Disable Patron Credit Library Setting]

NOTE: After applying changes to this library setting, it is necessary to restart
the staff client to see the changes take effect.  


Void vs. Forgive vs. Adjustment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The following are guidelines for using void, forgive, and adjust when clearing
bills off a patron record.

* Use forgive when staff is waiving a portion/all of a bill. A forgive_payment
payment type will be used to credit the bill. The history of the bill will be
retained. 

* Use void when the bill should not be on the patron record and when the goal
is to remove the entire bill. Once voided, there will be no history of the bill
available from the staff client. If the bill was partially paid before voiding,
a negative balance will be produced.

* Use adjust to zero when the bill should not be on the patron record and when 
the goal is to remove the balance of the bill. An account_adjustment payment
type will be used to adjust the bill's balance. The history of the bill will be
retained and available from the Bill History interface of the staff client.


Forgiving Bills 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Choose forgive as the payment type as described in the section
<<making_payments,Making Payments>>. 

Enter the amount to be forgiven.  Choose _Annotate Payment_ as required by local
policy.

Apply Payment.  Annotate, if prompted.

The screen will refresh to display the payment.
