[TIP]
On check-in, Evergreen will prompt staff to re-route the item to cataloging.

Due Dates
^^^^^^^^^

Circulation periods are pre-set. When items are checked out, due dates are automatically calculated and inserted into circulation records if the *Specific Due Date* checkbox is not selected on the Check Out screen. The *Specific Due Date* checkbox allows you to set a different due date to override the pre-set loan period.

Before you scan the item, select the *Specific Due Date* checkbox. Use the calendar widget to select a date. Or click in day, month or year, then use the up or down arrows to make the change or simply delete the data, then enter again. Time is used for hourly loan only. This date applies to all items until you change the date, de-select the *Specific Due Date* checkbox, or quit the patron record.

====================================================
  
Renewal and Editing the Item's Due Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checked-out items can be renewed if your library's policy allows it. The new due date is calculated from the renewal date. Existing loans can also be extended to a specific date by editing the due date or renewing with a specific due date.

Marking Items Lost and Claimed Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lost Items
^^^^^^^^^^
1) To mark items Lost, retrieve patron record and click *Items Out*.

2) Select the item. Click on *Actions for Selected Items* -> *Mark Lost (by Patron)*.

image::media/mark_lost.png[]

3) The lost item now displays in the *Lost/Claimed Returned/Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Billings* section of the patron record.

image::media/lost_cr_section.png[]

4) The lost item also adds to the count of *Lost* items in the patron summary on the left (or top) of the screen. 

image::media/patron_summary_checkouts.jpg[]

[NOTE]
Lost Item Billing
========================
- Marking an item Lost will automatically bill the patron the replacement cost of the item as recorded in the price field in the item record, and a processing fee as determined by your local policy. If the lost item has overdue charges, the overdue charges may be voided or retained based on local policy.
- A lost-then-returned item will disappear from the Items Out screen only when all bills linked to this particular circulation have been resolved. Bills may include replacement charges, processing fees, and manual charges added to the existing bills. 
- The replacement fee and processing fee for lost-then-returned items may be voided if set by local policy. Overdue fines may be reinstated on lost-then-returned items if set by local policy.
==========================

Refunds for Lost Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an item is returned after a lost bill has been paid and the library's policy is to void the replacement fee for lost-then-returned items, there will be a negative balance in the bill. A refund needs to be made to close the bill and the circulation record. Once the outstanding amount has been refunded, the bill and circulation record will be closed and the item will disappear from the Items Out screen.

If you need to balance a bill with a negative amount and close the linked lost circulation record without making a refund (removing the item from the *Lost, Claimed Returned, Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Bills* panel on the *Items Out* screen), you need to add two dummy bills to the existing bills. The first one can be of any amount (e.g. $0.01), while the second should be of the absolute value of the negative amount. Then you need to void the first dummy bill. The reason for using a dummy bill is that Evergreen will check and close the circulation record only when payment is applied or bills are voided.

Claimed Returned Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) To mark an item Claimed Returned, retrieve the patron record and go to the *Items Out* screen.

2) Select the item, then select *Actions for Selected Items* -> *Mark Claimed Returned* from the dropdown menu.

image::media/mark_claims_returned.png[]

3) Select a date and click *Apply*.

image::media/claimed_date.png[]

4) The Claimed Returned item now displays in the *Lost/Claimed Returned/Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Billings* section of the patron record.

image::media/lost_cr_section.png[]

5) The Claimed Returned item adds to the count of Check Outs that are Claimed Returned in the patron summary on the left (or top) of the screen. It also adds to the total *Claims-returned Count* (including those that are current Check Outs and those that have since been returned) that is displayed when editing the patron's record. 

image::media/patron_summary_checkouts.jpg[]

[NOTE]
More on Claimed Returned Items
====================================
- The date entered for a Claimed Returned item establishes the fine. If the date given has passed, bills will be adjusted accordingly.
- When a Claimed Returned item is returned, if there is an outstanding bill associated with it, the item will not disappear from the *Items Out* screen. It will disappear when the outstanding bills are resolved.
- When an item is marked Claimed Returned, the value in *Claims-returned Count* field in the patron record is automatically increased. Staff can manually adjust this count by editing the patron record.

3) Following the above procedure, you can check in and renew items by using the *Check in Items* and *Renew Items* on the dropdown menu.

Item alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Edit Item Attributes* function on the *Actions for Selected Items* dropdown list allows you to edit item records. Here, we will show you how to insert item alert messages by this function. See cataloging instructions for more information on item editing.

Mark an Item Long Overdue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Marking an item Long Overdue*

Once an item has been overdue for a configurable amount of time, Evergreen will mark the item long overdue in the borrowing patron’s account.  This will be done automatically through a Notification/Action Trigger.   When the item is marked long overdue, several actions will take place:

. The item will go into the status of “Long Overdue” 

. The item will be moved to the “Lost, Claimed Returned, Long Overdue, Has Unpaid Billings” section of the Items Out screen in the patron’s account

. The accrual of overdue fines will be stopped

Optionally the patron can be billed for the item price, a long overdue processing fee, and any overdue fines can be voided from the account.  Patrons can also be sent a notification that the item was marked long overdue.
 
image::media/long_overdue1.jpg[Patron Account-Long Overdue]


*Checking in a Long Overdue item*

If an item that has been marked long overdue is checked in, an alert will appear on the screen informing the staff member that the item was long overdue.  Once checked in, the item will go into the status of “In process”.  Optionally, the item price and long overdue processing fee can be voided and overdue fines can be reinstated on the patron’s account.  If the item is checked in at a library other than its home library, a library setting controls whether the item can immediately fill a hold or circulate, or if it needs to be sent to its home library for processing.
 
image::media/long_overdue2.jpg[Long Overdue Checkin]
 
*Notification/Action Triggers*

Evergreen has two sample Notification/Action Triggers that are related to marking items long overdue.  The sample triggers are configured for 6 months.  These triggers can be configured for any amount of time according to library policy and will need to be activated for use.

* Sample Triggers

** 6 Month Auto Mark Long-Overdue—will mark an item long overdue after the configured period of time

** 6 Month Long Overdue Notice—will send patron notification that an item has been marked long overdue on their account

*Library Settings* 

The following Library Settings enable you to set preferences related to long overdue items:

* *Circulation: Long-Overdue Check-In Interval Uses Last Activity Date* —Use the long-overdue last-activity date instead of the due_date to determine whether the item has been checked out too long to perform long-overdue check-in processing. If set, the system will first check the last payment time, followed by the last billing time, followed by the due date. See also circ.max_accept_return_of_longoverdue 

* *Circulation: Long-Overdue Items Usable on Checkin* —Long-overdue items are usable on checkin instead of going "home" first

* *Circulation: Long-Overdue Max Return Interval* —Long-overdue check-in processing (voiding fees, re-instating overdues, etc.) will not take place for items that have been overdue for (or have last activity older than) this amount of time 

* *Circulation: Restore Overdues on Long-Overdue Item Return*

* *Circulation: Void Long-Overdue item Billing When Returned*

* *Circulation: Void Processing Fee on Long-Overdue Item Return*

* *Finances: Leave transaction open when long overdue balance equals zero* —Leave transaction open when long-overdue balance equals zero. This leaves the lost copy on the patron record when it is paid

* *Finances: Long-Overdue Materials Processing Fee*

* *Finances: Void Overdue Fines When Items are Marked Long-Overdue*

*Permissions to use this Feature*

The following permissions are related to this feature:

* COPY_STATUS_LONGOVERDUE.override

** Allows the user to check-in long-overdue items thus removing the long-overdue status on the item
