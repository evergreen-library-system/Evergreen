Placing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be placed by staff in the _Staff Client_ and by patrons in the OPAC. In this chapter we demonstrate placing holds in the _Staff Client_.

Holds Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen has different levels of holds. Library staff can place holds at all levels, while patrons can only place title-level holds, and parts-level holds. The chart below summarizes the levels of holds.

|==============================
|*Hold level* |*Abbreviation* |*When to use*        |*How to use*   |*Who can use*    |*Hold tied to*
|Title        |T              |Patron wants first available copy of a title  | Staff or patron click on _Place Hold_ next to title. | Patron or staff | Holdings attached to a single MARC (title) record
|Parts        |P              |Patron wants a particular part of title (e.g. volume or disk number)    | Staff or patron selects part on the create/edit hold screen when setting holds notification options.   |Patron or staff  |Holdings with identical parts attached to a single MARC (title) record.
|Volume       |V              |Patron or staff want any title associated with a particular call number | In the staff client, click on _Volume Hold_ under _Holdable?_ |Staff only |Holdings attached to a single call number (volume)

Title Level Hold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[TIP]
====================
A default hold expiration date will be displayed if the library has set up a default holds expiration period in their library settings. Uncaptured holds will not be targeted after the expiration date.

If you select the _Suspend this Hold_ checkbox, the hold will be suspended and not be captured until you activate it.
====================

. To place a title level hold, retrieve the title record on the catalog and click the _Place Hold_ link beside the title on the search results list, or click the _Place Hold_ link on the title summary screen.

. Scan or type patron's barcode into the _Place hold for patron by
barcode_ box, or choose _Place this hold for me_.
. If this title contains multiple parts, you can specify which part to
request. If you do not select a part, the hold will target any of the
other copies on this record, that is, those with no parts attached.
Those copies are usually the complete set, containing all the parts.
. Edit patron hold notification and expiration date fields as required.
Be sure to choose a valid _Pickup location_.
. Click _Submit_.

*Advanced Hold Options*

Clicking the *Advanced Hold Options* link will take you into the
metarecord level hold feature, where you can select multiple formats
and/or languages, if available.

Selecting multiple formats will not place all of these formats on hold.
For example, selecting CD Audiobook and Book implies that either the CD
format or the book format is the acceptable format to fill the hold. If
no format is selected, then any of the available formats may be used to
fill the hold. The same holds true for selecting multiple languages.

Patron Search from Place Hold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Patron Search from Place Hold allows staff members, when placing a hold on behalf of a patron in the web staff client, to search for patrons by names and other searchable patron information, rather than relying on barcode alone.


To use Patron Search From Place Holds:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. After performing a search in the catalog, staff will retrieve a bibliographic record.
2. Click *Place Hold* either in the search results or within the detailed bibliographic record. The Place Hold Screen will appear. Note: this feature also appears when placing volume level holds and copy level holds.

3. Next to _Place Hold for patron by barcode_, click on *Patron Search*. Please note that Patron Search will only appear in this interface when using the web-based staff client.  It will not appear in the patron-facing OPAC.
+

7. The dialog box will close and the selected patron's barcode will appear next to _Place Hold for patron by barcode_. This will cause the patron's hold notification preferences to appear in the relevant fields in the bottom half of the screen. Changes to the Hold Notification preferences can be made before clicking *Submit* to finish placing a hold for the patron.
