[TIP]
============================================================================
* Requested fields may be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_ (_Admin ->
 Local Admin -> Library Settings Editor_).  
* Statistical categories may be created for information tracked by your library 
that is not in the default patron record.  
* These may be configured in the _Statistical Categories Editor_ (_Admin -> 
Local Admin -> Statistical Categories Editor_).  
* Staff accounts may also function as patron accounts.
* You must select a _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ before the _Update Expire
Date_ button will work, since the permission group determines the expiration date.
============================================================================


Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Abstract*

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.  

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

. Patrons will see a confirmation message: “Registration successful!  Please see library staff to complete your registration.”

image::media/patron_self_registration2.jpg[Patron Self-Registration form]

*Managing Pending Patrons*

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Select the patron you would like to review.  In this screen you have the option to *Load* the pending patron information to create a permanent library account.

. To create a permanent library account for the patron, click on the patron’s row, click on the *Load Patron* button at the top of the screen.  This will load the patron self-registration information into the main *Patron Registration* form. 

. Fill in the necessary patron information for your library, and click *Save* to create the permanent patron account.

=======


Renewing Library Cards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[library cards, renewing]

Expired patron accounts when initially retrieved – an alert
stating that the ``Patron account is EXPIRED.''

image::media/circulation_patron_records-11_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 11]

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Navigate to the information field labeled _Privilege Expiration Date_.  Enter a
new date in this box.  When you place your cursor in the _Patron Expiration Date
box_, a calendar widget will display to help you easily navigate to the desired
date. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-12.png[circulation_patron_records 12]

Select the date using the calendar widget or key the date in manually.  Click
the _Save_ button.  The screen will refresh and the ``expired'' alerts on the
account will be removed. 


Lost Library Cards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[library cards, replacing]

Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.
 
Next to the _Barcode_ field, select the _Replace Barcode_ button.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-13.png[circulation_patron_records 13]

This will clear the barcode field.  Enter a new barcode and _Save_ the record.
The screen will refresh and the new barcode will display in the patron summary
pane.  

If a patron’s barcode is mistakenly replaced, the old barcode may be reinstated.
Retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. Open the patron record in
edit mode as described in the section <<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Select the _See All_ button next to the _Replace Barcode_ button.  This will
display the current and past barcodes associated with this account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-14.png[circulation_patron_records 14]

Check the box(es) for all barcodes that should be ``active'' for the patron.  An
``active'' barcode may be used for circulation transactions.  A patron may have
more than one ``active'' barcode.  Only one barcode may be designated
``primary.'' The ``primary'' barcode displays in the patron’s summary
information in the _Library Card_ field. 

Once you have modified the patron barcode(s), _Save_ the patron record.  If you
modified the ``primary'' barcode, the new primary barcode will display in the
patron summary screen. 

Resetting Patron's Password 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, passwords]

A patron’s password may be reset from the OPAC or through the staff client.  To
reset the password from the staff client, retrieve the patron record as
described in the section <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Select the _Reset Password_ button next to the _Password_ field.  

image::media/circulation_patron_records-15.png[circulation_patron_records 15]

NOTE: The existing password is not displayed in patron records for security
reasons.

A new number will populate the _Password_ and _Verify Password_ text boxes.
Make note of the new password and _Save_ the patron record.  The screen will
refresh and the new password will be suppressed from view.   


[TIP]
=======================
If you need to change a patron or staff account password without using the staff client, here is how you can reset it with SQL.

Connect to your Evergreen database using _psql_ or similar tool, and retreive and verify your admin username:

[source, sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
psql -U <user-name> -h <hostname> -d <database>

SELECT id, usrname, passwd from actor.usr where usrname = 'admin';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not remember the username that you set, search for it in the _actor.usr_ table, and then reset the password.

[source, sql]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE actor.usr SET passwd = <password> WHERE id=<id of row to be updated>;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new password will automatically be hashed. 

=======================


Barring a Patron 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

A patron may be barred from circulation activities.  To bar a patron, retrieve
the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Check the box for _Barred_ in the patron account. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-16.png[circulation_patron_records 16]

_Save_ the user.  The screen will refresh.  

NOTE: Barring a patron from one library bars that patron from all consortium
member libraries. 

To unbar a patron, uncheck the Barred checkbox.


Barred vs. Blocked 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

*Barred*: Stops patrons from using their library cards; alerts the staff that
the patron is banned/barred from the library. The ``check-out'' functionality is
disabled for barred patrons (NO option to override – the checkout window is
unusable and the bar must be removed from the account before the patron is able
to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds fine threshold 
* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.


Staff-Generated Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_messages]]
indexterm:[patrons, messages]

There are several types of messages available for staff to leave notes on patron records.

*Patron Notes*: These notes are added via _Other_ -> _Notes_ in the patron record. These notes can be viewable by staff only or shared with the patron. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> for more.)

*Patron Alerts*: This type of alert is added via _Edit_ button in the patron record. There is currently no way to require staff initials for this type of alert. (See the section <<circulation_patron_alerts,Patron Alerts>> for more.)

*Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages*: These messages are added via the _Messages_ button in the patron record. They can be a note, alert or block. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<staff_generated_penalties_web_client,Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages>> for more.)

Patron Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_alerts]]
indexterm:[patrons, Alerts]
    
When an account has an alert on it, a Stop sign is displayed when the record is
retrieved.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-18_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 18]

Navigating to an area of the patron record using the navigation buttons at the
top of the record (for example, Edit or Bills) will clear the message from view.

If you wish to view these alerts after they are cleared from view, they may be
retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-19_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 19]

There are two types of Patron Alerts:

*System-generated alerts*: Once the cause is resolved (e.g. patron's account has
been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Enter the alert text in the Alert Message field.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-20.png[circulation_patron_records 20]

_Save_ the record. The screen will refresh and the alert will display.

To remove the alert, retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Delete the alert text in the _Alert Message_ field. 

_Save_ the record.  

The screen will refresh and the indicators for the alert will be removed from 
the account. 

Patron Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_notes]]
indexterm:[patrons, Notes]

Notes are strictly communicative and may be made visible to the patron via their
account on the OPAC.  In the OPAC, these notes display on the account summary
screen in the OPAC.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-23_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 23]

To insert or remove a note, retrieve the patron record as described in the
section  <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>.

Use the Other menu to navigate to _Notes_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-24_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 24]

Select the _Add New Note_ button. A _Create a new note_ window displays.  

[TIP]

Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_penalties_web_client]]
To access this feature, use the _Messages_ button in the patron record.

image::media/staff-penalties-1_web_client.png[Messages screen]

Add a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click *Apply Penalty/Message* to begin the process of adding a message to the patron.

image::media/staff-penalties-2_web_client.png[Apply Penalty Dialog Box]

There are three options: Notes, Alerts, Blocks

* *Note*: This will create a non-blocking, non-alerting note visible to staff. Staff can view the message by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record.  (Notes created in this fashion will not display via _Other_ -> _Notes_, and cannot be shared with the patron. See the <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> section for notes which can be shared with the patron.)

* *Alert*: This will create a non-blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved.  The alert will cause the patron name to display in red, rather than black, text. Alerts may be viewed by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record or by selecting _Other_ -> _Display Alerts and Messages_.

* *Block*: This will create a blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved, and which behaves much as the non-blocking alert described previously. The patron will be also blocked from circulation, holds and renewals until the block is cleared by staff.

After selecting the type of message to create, enter the message body into the box. If Staff Initials are required, they must be entered into the _Initials_ box before the message can be added.  Otherwise, fill in the optional _Initials_ box and click *OK*

The message should now be visible in the _Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages_ list. If a blocking or non-blocking alert, the message will also display immediately when the patron record is retrieved.

image::media/staff-penalties-3_web_client.png[[Messages on a record]

Modify a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages can be edited by staff after they are created. 

image::media/staff-penalties-4_web_client.png[[Actions menu]

Click to select the message to be modified, then click _Actions_ -> _Modify Penalty/Message_. This menu can also be accessed by right-clicking in the message area.

image::media/staff-penalties-5_web_client.png[Modify penalty dialog box]

To change the type of message, click on *Note*, *Alert*, *Block* to select the new type. Edit or add new text in the message body.  Enter Staff Initials into the _Initials_ box (may be required.) and click *OK* to submit the alterations.

image::media/staff-penalties-6_web_client.png[Modified message in the list]

Archive a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages which are no longer current can be archived by staff. This action will remove any alerts or blocks associated with the message, but retains the information contained there for future reference.

image::media/staff-penalties-4_web_client.png[[Actions menu]

Click to select the message to be archived, then click _Actions_ -> _Archive Penalty/Message_. This menu can also be accessed by right-clicking in the message area.

Archived messages will be shown in the section labelled _Archived Penalties/Messages_. To view messages, click *Retrieve Archived Penalties*. By default, messages archived within the past year will be retrieved. To retrieve messages from earlier dates, change the start date to the desired date before clicking *Retrieve Archived Penalties*.
