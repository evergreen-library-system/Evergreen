.Tips for searching 
[TIP] 
=================== 
* Search one field or combine fields for more precise results.  
* Truncate search terms for more search results.
* Search ignores punctuation such as diacritics, apostrophes, hyphens and commas.
* Searching by Date of Birth: Year searches are "contains" searches. E.g. year
  "15" matches 2015, 1915, 1599, etc. For exact matches use the full 4-digit
  year. Day and month values are exact matches. E.g. month "1" (or "01") matches
  January, "12" matches December.
===================

Once you have located the desired patron, click on the entry row for this patron in
the results screen.  A summary for this patron will display on the left hand side.  

image::media/circulation_patron_records-2_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 2]

The _Patron Search_ button on the upper right may be used to resume searching for patrons.

Retrieve Recent Patrons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, retrieving recent]

Setting up Retrieve Recent Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* This feature must be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor_). The
library setting is called "Number of Retrievable Recent Patrons" and is located
in the Circulation settings group.
** A value of zero (0) means no recent patrons can be retrieved.
** A value greater than 1 means staff will be able to retrieve multiple recent
patrons via a new _Circulation -> Retrieve Recent Patrons_ menu entry.
** The default value is 1 for backwards compatibility. (The _Circulation ->
Retrieve Last Patron_ menu entry will be available.)

Retrieving Recent Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Once the library setting has been configured to a number greater than 1, the
option Retrieve Recent Patrons will appear below the Retrieve Last patron
option in the Circulation drop-down from the Menu Bar (_Circulation ->
Retrieve Recent Patrons_).

* When selected, a grid will appear listing patrons accessed by that workstation
in the current session. The length of the list will be limited by the value
configured in the _Library Settings Editor_. If no patrons have been accessed,
the grid will display "No Items To Display."


Registering New Patrons 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, registering]

To register a new patron, select _Circulation -> Register Patron_ from the menu bar. The Patron
Registration form will display. 

image::media/circulation_patron_records-4.JPG[Patron registration form]

Mandatory fields display in yellow.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-5.JPG[circulation_patron_records 5]

The _Show: Required Fields_ and _Show: Suggested Fields_ links may be used to limit
the options on this page.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-6.JPG[circulation_patron_records 6]

When finished entering the necessary information, select _Save_ to save the new
patron record or _Save & Clone_ to register a patron with the same address.
When _Save & Clone_ is selected, the address information is copied into the
resulting patron registration screen.  It is linked to the original patron.
Address information may only be edited through the original record.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-8.JPG[circulation_patron_records 8]

[TIP]
============================================================================
* Requested fields may be configured in the _Library Settings Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor_).
* Statistical categories may be created for information tracked by your library 
that is not in the default patron record.
* These may be configured in the _Statistical Categories Editor_
(_Administration -> Local Administration -> Statistical Categories Editor_).
* Staff accounts may also function as patron accounts.
* You must select a _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ before the _Update Expire
Date_ button will work, since the permission group determines the expiration date.
============================================================================

Email field
^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[patrons,email addresses]
indexterm:[email]

It's possible for administrators to set up the email field to allow or disallow
multiple email addresses for a single patron (usually separated by a comma).
If you'd like to make changes to whether multiple email addresses
are allowed here or not, ask your system administrator to change the
`ui.patron.edit.au.email.regex` library setting.


Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Abstract*

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.  

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

. Patrons will see a confirmation message: “Registration successful!  Please see library staff to complete your registration.”

image::media/patron_self_registration2.jpg[Patron Self-Registration form]

*Managing Pending Patrons*

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Select the patron you would like to review.  In this screen you have the option to *Load* the pending patron information to create a permanent library account.

. To create a permanent library account for the patron, click on the patron’s row, click on the *Load Patron* button at the top of the screen.  This will load the patron self-registration information into the main *Patron Registration* form. 

. Fill in the necessary patron information for your library, and click *Save* to create the permanent patron account.

NOTE: Barring a patron from one library bars that patron from all consortium
member libraries. 

To unbar a patron, uncheck the Barred checkbox.


Barred vs. Blocked 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons, barring]

*Barred*: Stops patrons from using their library cards; alerts the staff that
the patron is banned/barred from the library. The ``check-out'' functionality is
disabled for barred patrons (NO option to override – the checkout window is
unusable and the bar must be removed from the account before the patron is able
to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds fine threshold 
* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.


Staff-Generated Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_messages]]
indexterm:[patrons, messages]

There are several types of messages available for staff to leave notes on patron records.

*Patron Notes*: These notes are added via _Other_ -> _Notes_ in the patron record. These notes can be viewable by staff only or shared with the patron. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> for more.)

*Patron Alerts*: This type of alert is added via _Edit_ button in the patron record. There is currently no way to require staff initials for this type of alert. (See the section <<circulation_patron_alerts,Patron Alerts>> for more.)

*Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages*: These messages are added via the _Messages_ button in the patron record. They can be a note, alert or block. Staff initials can be required. (See the section <<staff_generated_penalties_web_client,Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages>> for more.)

Patron Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_alerts]]
indexterm:[patrons, Alerts]
    
When an account has an alert on it, a Stop sign is displayed when the record is
retrieved.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-18_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 18]

Navigating to an area of the patron record using the navigation buttons at the
top of the record (for example, Edit or Bills) will clear the message from view.

If you wish to view these alerts after they are cleared from view, they may be
retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-19_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 19]

There are two types of Patron Alerts:

*System-generated alerts*: Once the cause is resolved (e.g. patron's account has
been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Enter the alert text in the Alert Message field.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-20.png[circulation_patron_records 20]

_Save_ the record. The screen will refresh and the alert will display.

To remove the alert, retrieve the patron record as described in the section
<<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section 
<<updating_patron_information,Updating Patron Information>>.

Delete the alert text in the _Alert Message_ field. 

_Save_ the record.  

The screen will refresh and the indicators for the alert will be removed from 
the account. 

Patron Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[circulation_patron_notes]]
indexterm:[patrons, Notes]

Notes are strictly communicative and may be made visible to the patron via their
account on the OPAC.  In the OPAC, these notes display on the account summary
screen in the OPAC.

image::media/circulation_patron_records-23_web_client.png[circulation_patron_records 23]

To insert or remove a note, retrieve the patron record as described in the
section  <<searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>.

Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[staff_generated_penalties_web_client]]
To access this feature, use the _Messages_ button in the patron record.

image::media/staff-penalties-1_web_client.png[Messages screen]

Add a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click *Apply Penalty/Message* to begin the process of adding a message to the patron.

image::media/staff-penalties-2_web_client.png[Apply Penalty Dialog Box]

There are three options: Notes, Alerts, Blocks

* *Note*: This will create a non-blocking, non-alerting note visible to staff. Staff can view the message by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record.  (Notes created in this fashion will not display via _Other_ -> _Notes_, and cannot be shared with the patron. See the <<circulation_patron_notes,Patron Notes>> section for notes which can be shared with the patron.)

* *Alert*: This will create a non-blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved.  The alert will cause the patron name to display in red, rather than black, text. Alerts may be viewed by clicking the _Messages_ button on the patron record or by selecting _Other_ -> _Display Alerts and Messages_.

* *Block*: This will create a blocking alert which appears when the patron record is first retrieved, and which behaves much as the non-blocking alert described previously. The patron will be also blocked from circulation, holds and renewals until the block is cleared by staff.

After selecting the type of message to create, enter the message body into the box. If Staff Initials are required, they must be entered into the _Initials_ box before the message can be added.  Otherwise, fill in the optional _Initials_ box and click *OK*

The message should now be visible in the _Staff-Generated Penalties/Messages_ list. If a blocking or non-blocking alert, the message will also display immediately when the patron record is retrieved.

image::media/staff-penalties-3_web_client.png[[Messages on a record]

image::media/staff-penalties-6_web_client.png[Modified message in the list]

Archive a Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages which are no longer current can be archived by staff. This action will remove any alerts or blocks associated with the message, but retains the information contained there for future reference.

image::media/staff-penalties-4_web_client.png[[Actions menu]

Click to select the message to be archived, then click _Actions_ -> _Archive Penalty/Message_. This menu can also be accessed by right-clicking in the message area.

* Statistical Categories

Batch modifications and deletions can be rolled back or reversed, with the exception of batch changes to statistical categories.  Batch changes made in User Buckets will not activate any Action/Trigger event definitions that would normally be activated when editing an individual account.

User accounts can be added to User Buckets by scanning individual user barcodes or by uploading a file of user barcodes directly in the User Bucket interface.  They can also be added to a User Bucket from the Patron Search screen.  Batch changes and batch edit sets are tied to the User Bucket itself, not to the login of the bucket owner.
