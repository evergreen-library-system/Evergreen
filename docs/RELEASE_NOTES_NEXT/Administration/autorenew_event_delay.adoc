Change in AutoRenew Event Definition Default Delay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The delay for the AutoRenew event has been changed from -23 hours to
-24 hours and 1 minute.  The previous values of -23 hours for the
delay and -1 minute for the max_delay left a gap of approximately 1
hour where items would not auto-renew if they fell due during that
time.  Depending upon the time that the AutoRenew event runner is
scheduled to run, this gap may never turn up.  However, all it takes
is a misconfigured client (i.e. an incorrect timezone setting) or a
manually edited due date on a circulation for this to turn up.  The
new interval settings guarantee that all circulations for a given 24
hour period are selected with no gap.

A database upgrade script is provided to alter any event definitions
using the Circ::Autorenew reactor and the previous default delay
values to the new settings.  If you have customized or added any event
definitions using this reactor, you should double check that they are
correct after an upgrade.
