== Angular CLI No Longer Installed Globally ==

The Evergreen installation process no longer installs
the Angular CLI globally.  All angular commands are
still available with the `npx` prefix.  For example,
`ng build` is now `npx ng build`.

Anybody who relies on the Angular CLI being installed
globally can install it with `npm i -g @angular/cli@^18.0`
