Configuring sign-on to OpenAthens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your institution uses OpenAthens single sign-on, you can configure Evergreen 
to link with OpenAthens. This will let patrons connect to OpenAthens resources 
seamlessly once they have logged in to Evergreen. Patrons are automatically 
assigned an OpenAthens identity dynamically based on their Evergreen login, 
and do not need accounts created manually in OpenAthens.

Registering your Evergreen installation with the OpenAthens service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using your OpenAthens administrator account at https://admin.openathens.net/, 
complete the following steps:

. Register a local authentication connection for Evergreen:
  .. Go to *Management* -> *Connections*.
  .. Under *Local authentication* click *Add*.
  .. In the wizard that appears, select *Evergreen* as the local authentication 
  system type (or *API* if Evergreen is not listed) and click *Configure*.
  .. For *Display name*, enter the name of your Evergreen portal that your 
  patrons will be familiar with. They will need to be able to recognise and 
  select this name from a list of sign-in options on OpenAthens.
  .. For *Callback URL* enter *https://<HOSTNAME>/eg/opac/sso/openathens* where 
  <HOSTNAME> is the public hostname of your Evergreen installation, and click 
  *Save*. (If you have installed Evergreen somewhere other than /eg, modify the
  URL accordingly.)
  .. On the details page that appears, take a copy of the *Connection ID* and 
  *Connection URI* that have been generated. You will need these when 
  configuring Evergreen.
. Generate an API key:
  .. Go to *Management* -> *API keys* and click *Add*.
  .. For *Name*, enter 'Evergreen' or whatever name you use for your Evergreen 
  portal internally, and click *Save*.
  .. Take a copy of the 36-character key that has been generated. You will need 
  this when configuring Evergreen.

Full OpenAthens documentation for local authentication API connections is 
available at http://docs.openathens.net/display/public/MD/API+connector.

Configuring Evergreen
+++++++++++++++++++++
OpenAthens sign-on is configured in the staff client under *Local 
Administration* -> *OpenAthens Sign-on*. To make a connection, select *New 
Sign-on to OpenAthens*, and set the values as follows:

* *Owner* - the organisation within your library hierarchy that owns the 
connection to OpenAthens. If your whole consortium has signed up to OpenAthens 
as a single customer, then you would select the top-level. If only one 
regional library system or branch is the OpenAthens customer, select that. 
Whichever organisation you select, the OpenAthens connection will take effect 
for all libraries below it in your organisational hierarchy. A single 
OpenAthens sign-on configuration normally equates to a single *domain* in the 
OpenAthens service. If in doubt refer to your OpenAthens account manager or 
implementation partner.
* *Active* - Enable this connection (enabled by default).
* *API key* - the 36-character OpenAthens *API key* that was generated in step 
  2 above.
* *Connection ID* - the numerical *Connection ID* that was generated for the 
  OpenAthens local authentication connection in step 1 above.
* *Connection URI* - the *Connection URI* that was generated for the 
  OpenAthens local authentication connection in step 1 above.
* *Auto sign-on* - controls _when_ patrons are signed on to OpenAthens:
  ** *enabled* (recommended) - As soon as a patron logs in to Evergreen, they 
  are signed in to OpenAthens. This happens via a quick redirect that the user 
  should not notice.
  ** *disabled* - The patron is not signed in to OpenAthens to start with. When 
  they first access an OpenAthens-protected resource, they will need to search 
  for your institution at the OpenAthens log-in page and choose your Evergreen 
  portal as the sign-in method (they will see the name you entered as the 
  *Display name* in step 1 above). Evergreen will then prompt for log-in if 
  they have not already logged in. After that, they are signed in to OpenAthens 
  and OpenAthens redirects them to the resource.
* *Auto sign-out* - controls whether the patron is signed out of OpenAthens 
  when they log out of Evergreen. If *enabled* the patron will be sent to the 
  OpenAthens sign-out page when they log out of Evergreen. You can optionally 
  configure the OpenAthens service to send them back to your home page again 
  after this; the setting can be found at https://admin.openathens.net/ under 
  *Preferences* -> *Domain* -> *After sign out*.
* *Unique identifier field* - controls which attribute of patron accounts is 
  used as the unique identifier in OpenAthens. The supported values are 'id' 
  and 'usrname', but you should leave this set to the default value of 'id' 
  unless you have a reason to do otherwise. It is important that this attribute 
  does not change during the lifetime of a patron account, otherwise they would 
  lose any personalised settings they have saved on third party resources. It 
  is also important that you do not re-use old patron accounts for new users, 
  otherwise a new user could see personalised settings saved by an old user.
* *Display name field* - controls which attribute of patron accounts is 
  displayed in the OpenAthens portal at https://admin.openathens.net/. (This 
  is where you can see which accounts have been used, and what use patrons are 
  making of third party resources.) The supported values are 'id', 'usrname' 
  and 'fullname'. Whichever you choose, OpenAthens will only use it within 
  your portal view; it won't be released to third-party resources.
* *Release X* - one setting for each of the attributes that it is possible to 
  release to OpenAthens. Depending on your user privacy policy, you can 
  configure any of these attributes to be released to OpenAthens as part of 
  the sign-on process. None are enabled by default. OpenAthens in turn doesn't 
  store or release any of these attributes to third party resources, unless 
  you configure that separately in the OpenAthens portal. You have to 
  configure this in two stages. Firstly, mapping Evergreen attributes to 
  OpenAthens attributes, and secondly releasing OpenAthens attributes to third 
  party resources. See the OpenAthens documenation pages at 
  http://docs.openathens.net/display/public/MD/Attribute+mapping and 
  http://docs.openathens.net/display/public/MD/Attribute+release. You will need 
  to know the exact names of the attributes that are released. These are listed 
  in the following table:

|===
|Setting|Attribute released|Description

|Release prefix
|prefix
|the patron's prefix, overriden by the preferred prefix if that is set

|Release first name
|first_given_name
|the patron's first name, overriden by the preferred first name if that is set

|Release middle name
|second_given_name
|the patron's middle name, overriden by the preferred middle name if that is set

|Release surname
|family_name
|the patron's last name, overriden by the preferred last name if that is set

|Release suffix
|suffix
|the patron's suffix, overriden by the preferred suffix if that is set

|Release email
|email
|the patron's email address

|Release home library
|home_ou
|the _shortcode_ of the patron's home library (e.g. 'BR1' in the Concerto 
sample data set)
|===

Network access - server
+++++++++++++++++++++++
As part of the sign-on process, Evergreen makes a connection to the OpenAthens
service to transfer details of the user that is signing on. This data does not
go via the user's browser, to avoid revealing the private API key and to avoid
the risk of spoofing. You need to open up port 443 outbound in your firewall,
from your Evergreen server to login.openathens.net.

Network access - web client
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you restrict internet access for your web client machines, you need to open
up port 443 outbound in your firewall, from your web clients to the following
three domains:

* connect.openathens.net
* login.openathens.net
* wayfinder.openathens.net

Admin permissions
+++++++++++++++++
To delegate OpenAthens configuration to other staff users, assign the 
*ADMIN_OPENATHENS* permission.
