== Staff-only and Public Catalog Library Groups ==

Before this release, library groups were visible in both the public catalog and
the staff catalog.  In this release, administrators can choose to display any
library group in the Public Catalog or not using the "OPAC Visible?" checkbox in
the Library Group administrative screen.  If it is checked, the library group
will display in both the staff catalog and the public catalog.  If it is
unchecked, it will only display in the staff catalog.

Any pre-existing library groups will automatically continue to be visible in the
public catalog until an dministrator configures them otherwise.
