Staged Search Tables and Functions Removed from Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This release removes the asset.opac_visible_copies materialized view and
search.query_parser_fts function from the Evergreen database.  They have been
obsolete since staged search was eliminated in Evergreen 3.0.  Any custom code
that relies on them should be updated accordingly.
