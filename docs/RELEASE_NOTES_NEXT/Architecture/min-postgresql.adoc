== New PostgreSQL Minimum Version ==

Evergreen 3.14 no longer supports new installations on PostgreSQL
versions less than 13.  Evergreen 3.14 is still compatible with
PostgreSQL versions of 10 or higher.  Existing installations may
upgrade to Evergreen 3.14 without requiring a PostreSQL upgrade.

Compatibility with obsolete PostgreSQL database versions is not
guaranteed in the next major Evergreen release.  Users are encouraged
to upgrade to a more recent PostgreSQL version if they are running
PostgreSQL versions between 10 and 12.

The PostgreSQL community recommends a dump and restore from the older
PostgreSQL database to the newer one when upgrading over major
versions.  For more information,
