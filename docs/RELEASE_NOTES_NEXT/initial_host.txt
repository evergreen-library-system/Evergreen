Staff Client Initial Hostname
-----------------------------

For fresh installs of the staff client a common issue is people remembering what hostname to specify. If you are building your own staff clients you can now fill this in automatically.

You can specify this when configuring Evergreen with a new configure option:

--with-initialhost=example.org

It is also possible to specify when building the staff client itself using the INITIAL_HOST variable:

make INITIAL_HOST=example.org build
