Support Reader Address Information in Routing Slip Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The serials routing slip template can now render user addresses if users with
addresses appear on a routing list. This feature is particularly useful for
working with homebound patrons. 

Sites that don't want to see a mailing or billing address can adjust the
default template. Sites that already use a customized template will not be 
affected.
