== ChiliFresh Cover Images ==

ChiliFresh is now avaialble as an added content source for cover
images. To enable (after getting a subscription), edit `opensrf.xml`
and set the `added_content/module` value to `OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::Chilifresh`.

The `added_content/base_url` value will also need to be set, typically to
"https://content.chilifresh.com/".

If you are supplied a "generic" code by ChiliFresh, that goes in the
`added_content/generic` element in `opensrf.xml`.
