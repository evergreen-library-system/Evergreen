== Restrict login redirect ==

As a security best-practice, Evergreen should not allow arbitrary
redirection on successful login, but instead limit redirection to
local links or configured domains and schemes.

This feature is controlled by a new global flag called *opac.login_redirect_domains*
which must contain a comma-separated list of domains.  All hostnames
under each domain is allowed for redirect, and the scheme of the
redirect URL must be one of http, https, ftp, or ftps.
