== Protect qtype CGI parameter ==

Malicious DoS attempts have been witnessed in the wild making use of
the fact that Evergreen does not check the contents of the qtype CGI
parameter.  While these fail their intent, it would be better to
simply drop such searches on the floor when they're seen.

Evergreen will now confirm that the search class in the qtype parameter
is valid, and that the remainder of the value is structured correctly,
before processing the search request.
