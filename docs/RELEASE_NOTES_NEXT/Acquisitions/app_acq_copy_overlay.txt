Opportunistic Acquisitions In-Process Copy Overlay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improves existing acquisitions copy overlay code (which matches and overlays
using specified IDs) by adding broader matching criteria. By selecting the new
option, _Auto Overlay In-process Acquisitions Copies_, the system will
potentially overlay copies which:

* have associated lineitem details (that is, they were created by the 
acquisitions process),
* that lineitem detail has the same owning_lib as the incoming copy's
owning_lib, and
* the current copy associated with that lineitem detail is _In process_.
