== Item status displays title information in the order presented in the MARC record ==

In previous versions of Evergreen, the subfields $n and $p appeared at the end of
the title in the Item Status screen, regardless of the order they appeared in the
MARC record's 245 field.

These subfields now appear in the order they were specified in the 245 field.

Note that if you have customized the mods32 XML transform, you will need to make
the relevant adjustments yourself: in the titleNonfiling section, the list of
subfields should include include 'n' and 'p', and this section should not call
the "part" template.
