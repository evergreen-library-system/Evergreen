== New Library Setting for Address Checks When Offering E-Renewal  ==

A new library setting, "Number of valid addresses needed to offer patron
account e-renewal via Quipu", is added to specify the number of valid
addresses that a patron record must have in order to be eligible for
e-renewal.

This setting takes a value of 0, 1, or 2:

 * 0: Do not consider the patron's addresses when checking whether to
   offer e-renewal
 * 1: Either the mailing address or the billing/physical address must
   be set and marked as valid for e-renewal to be offered.
 * 2: Both the mailing address and the billing/physical address must be
   set and marked as valid.

If the library setting is not set, the default value used is 2, following
the behavior before the setting was added.
