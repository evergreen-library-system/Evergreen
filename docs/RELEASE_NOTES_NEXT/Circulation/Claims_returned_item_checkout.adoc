== Mark Claims Returned Circs Finished Upon Subsequent Checkout ==

Before this change, circulations with a stop fines of
CLAIMSRETURNED would remain in the "Other/Special Circulations"
section of Items Out after the claimed-returned item is subsequently
checked out to another patron.

This approach assumes the item was, in fact, returned and avoids
charging additional fines to the original patron.  The old circ is
marked with a stop fines reason of "CHECKIN" at the time of the new
checkout.

If you want to apply this change retroactively to affected circulations,
refer your system administrator to the following SQL (edit to suit):

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE  action.circulation
SET     xact_finish = checkin_time,
        stop_fines_time = checkin_time,
        stop_fines = 'CHECKIN'
WHERE   stop_fines = 'CLAIMSRETURNED'
        AND xact_finish IS NULL
        AND checkin_time IS NOT NULL
        AND checkin_scan_time IS NOT NULL;
