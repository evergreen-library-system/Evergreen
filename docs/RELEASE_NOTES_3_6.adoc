== Evergreen  3.6.4 ==

This release contains bug fixes improving on Evergreen 3.6.3.

=== Upgrade notes ===

The addition of the Angular Staff Catalog surfaced a double-encoding issue
with redirects in certain Apache versions. This caused searches for multiple
words to have %20 in place of spaces, almost certainly resulting in 0 results.

In order to apply this fix, change the Angular redirects in eg_vhost.conf from

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [R=307,L]

to

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [NE,R=307,L]

== Evergreen 3.6.0 ==

=== Upgrade notes ===

This release adds a new OpenSRF service called `open-ils.courses`.
While strictly speaking this is an optional service and could be
omitted if you are not planning on using the new Course Materials
module, it is recommended that the service be run in case future
work bakes in an assumption that it will always be present.

This release also a new OpenSRF service, `open-ils.curbside`, which
must be enabled and registered with the public router for the
Curbside Pickup feature to function.

This release also includes a new experimental public catalog skin
based on the Bootstrap framework. Instructions for turning it on
can be found below.

This release adds a new Perl module dependency, `Config::General`.

This release adds two new rows to action_trigger.event_definition,
two into action_trigger.hook, and six into action_trigger.environment.

=== New Features ===

==== Acquisitions ====

===== Angular Acquisitions Search =====

The acquisitions search interfaces are now written in Angular
and provide a new centralized place for searching Line Items,
Purchase Orders, Invoices, and Selection Lists in the Acquisitions
module of Evergreen. The Acquisitions Search interface can be accessed
under Acquisitions -> General Search.

The search interface has four tabs for line item search, purchase order
search, invoices search, and selection list search.  Each tab
offers a search form allowing the user to select one or more
fields to search on. Each search tab stores a separate default search
that the user can update; for example, a user could have their
line item search default to showing all on-order line items from
a particular provider.

The grid that displays search results in each tab is filterable.

The line items and PO search interfaces allow the user to navigate to
linked POs, invoices, and so forth, but offers no direct actions. The
invoices search tab includes a 'Print Selected Invoices' action,
while the selection lists search tab offers actions to create,
clone, delete, and merge selection lists.

The Angular search page contains a link to the legacy Dojo search
interface if needed. The Dojo interface will be removed in a future
release of Evergreen.

The Angular search interface offers various usability improvements
over the Dojo interface, including:

* only the search operators that are relevant for a given field
  are displayed.
* search fields that are associated with controlled vocabularies
  will display drop-downs on the search form.
* results are sortable.
* the line item and PO state fields have been relabeled to "Status".
* greater than and less than are now available as search operators.
* publication date searches are more flexible.

As part of this feature, the stock permissions for the Acquisitions
and Acquisitions Administrator profiles have been expanded. In
particular, the Acquisitions Administrator profile can now be
more readily used to perform normal acquisitions work in addition
to configuring the acquisitions module.

===== Angular Providers Interface =====

The interfaces for searching for and managing Acquisitions provider
records have been rewritten in Angular. This rewrite includes the
following significant changes:

* The provider search interface is now available directly from the
  Acquisitions menu, supplementing its longstanding availability from
  the Acquisitions Administration page.
* The search interface is modeled after the patron interface, including
  a search form that can be hidden or displayed, a provider summary box,
  and a multi-tabbed interface for managing the provider itself.
* The grid displaying search results is filterable and sortable.
* The provider display tabs are
** Details, allowing the user to view, and if permitted, edit the base provider record.
** Addresses
** Contacts
** Attribute Definitions
** Holdings Definitions
** EDI
** Invoices, providing an interface for viewing the invoices associated with the provider.
** POs, providing an interface for viewing the purchase orders associated with the provider.
* The new interface makes it possible to edit contact addresses.
* The base provider record now has an optional primary contact field.
  Selecting a contact as the primary one is managed on the Contacts
  tab.  The primary contact, if set, is displayed on the provider
  summary box.

Interfaces that used to link to the Dojo provider interface now link
to the Angular one instead.

==== Administration ====


===== Changes to Autorenewal Action/Trigger Failure Reasons =====

Previously the "reason" field in the userdata for an Autorenewal
event would contain both the failure code and the description for
the failure event as a single string such as
"MAX_RENEWALS_REACHED : Circulation has no more renewals remaining."

Now the "reason" field will only contain the description of the issue
(Circulation has ...) while a new "textcode" field will contain the
event code (MAX_RENEWALS_REACHED) if administrators still want to
display it in template outputs.


===== EZProxy authentication =====

Evergreen can now provide CGI authentication for EZProxy.
To enable this, you will need to:

. Add a new User Activity Type to Evergreen for EZProxy CGI authentications.
. Add a new Remote Authentication Profile to Evergreen. You will probably want
to use `EZProxyCGI` as the name.
. Edit the `<Location /api/ezproxy>` stanza in Evergreen's eg_vhost configuration
file. In particular, you will need to allow access to from your EZProxy server,
fill in the base uri of your EZProxy server, and add a secret to the
_OILSRemoteAuthEZProxySecret_ variable.
. Restart Apache.
. Edit the EZProxy user.txt file.  You will likely want to add a stanza such
as the following:

.Sample user.txt stanza
----
::CGI=http://your-evergreen-catalog.com/api/ezproxy?url=^R
::Ticket
MD5 <same secret as in eg_vhost config>
Expired; Deny expiredticket.htm
/Ticket
----

When this feature is enabled, users will see an Evergreen-based login screen.
You may customize the look and feel of this login screen by editing the relevant
template toolkit files.

===== Matomo Support =====

Support for the open source web analytics platform Matomo is now
native to Evergreen. Support is on an org unit level so different
libraries can have separate or no analytics. Once you setup
a Matomo service you will need the URL and site ID. Typically
Matomo will give you a block of javascript you can insert into
web sites. One line will look like :

`var u="http://mylibrary.lib/matomo/";`

The full URL in the double quotes will be your URL.  Another line
will look like:

`_paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);`

In this case the number 1 will be your site ID.

These are set by the Library Settings opac.analytics.matomo_url and
opac.analytics.matomo_id respectively.  A new permission,
MATOMO_UPDATE_SETTINGS, controls access to these.

===== "PatronAPI" authentication =====

Evergreen now supports the III "PatronAPI" scheme for authenticating
patrons and supplying some information about them.

To enable this, you will need to:

. Add a new User Activity Type to Evergreen for PatronAPI authentications.
. Add a new Remote Authentication Profile to Evergreen. You will probably want
to use `PatronAPI` as the name.
. Edit the `<Location /api/patronapi>` stanza in Evergreen's eg_vhost configuration
file. In particular, you will need to allow access to it from the server(s)
wanting to make PatronAPI requests, determine whether to enable the PatronAPI
"dump" feature, and specify whether users can be identified by username
or barcode.
. Restart Apache.
. Update the PatronAPI client to use https://your.evergreen.server/api/patronapi
  as its base URL.

Example PatronAPI URLs look something like this:

.PatronAPI URLs
----
# test a patron's PIN:
https://evergreen.example.org/api/patronapi/USERNAME/PASSWORD/pintest

# dump some information about the patron. Note that this
# does _not_ require the the patron's password be supplied.
https://evergreen.example.org/api/patronapi/USERNAME/dump
----

The responses for the `pintest` and `dump` actions are specified by
Template Toolkit templates under (e.g.) `/openils/var/templates/remoteauth`.


===== Preloaded Audio Icon and Search Format =====

A new search and icon format called Preloaded Audio now exists
that overlaps with the eAudio format.  If you want to exclude
the Preloaded Audio format from overlapping with eAudio
you can use the following SQL:

----
UPDATE config.composite_attr_entry_definition SET definition = '{"0":{"_attr":"item_type","_val":"i"},"1":[{"_attr":"item_form","_val":"o"},{"_attr":"item_form","_val":"s"}]}'
    WHERE coded_value IN (SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE code = 'eaudio');
----

It is also recommended that you reingest your bibliographic records
to updated the fixed field indexes. You can accomplish this by running
the following query in your database:

----
SELECT metabib.reingest_record_attributes(source)
FROM metabib.record_attr_vector_list WHERE
(SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE ctype = 'item_form' AND code = 'q') = ANY(vlist)
AND (SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE ctype = 'item_type' AND code = 'i') = ANY(vlist);
----





==== API ====



===== Override Label for draw_field_label Patron Edit Fields =====

Evergreen developers may now specify a label for fields in
the patron registration/patron edit form (generated by
the draw_field_label macro). By default,
draw_field_label uses the label of supplied IDL field class.
Now a developer may supply an additional third parameter,
label_override, which overrides the default IDL-based label.
This would typically be done in the course of customizing
the web staff client template `circ/patron/t_edit.tt2`.




==== Architecture ====




===== New Action/Trigger reactor for 3rd party signaling =====

This new Action/Trigger reactor module allows an Evergreen administrator to
create event definitions that use HTTP (or HTTPS) to contact external services
and let them know that something has happened in Evergreen.

For instance, a discovery layer can be informed when a bib record is updated
or when a user's barcode changes.

====== Reactor Template Syntax ======

The new reactor module uses a template to define its behavior.  While the
template is processed by Template Toolkit, as with any A/T templates, its
output format is new to Evergreen.

The template should output data that can be parsed by the Config::General Perl
module.  See: https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::General

Top level settings should include the HTTP *method* and the *url*.

A block called *Headers* can be used to supply arbitrary HTTP headers.

A block called *Parameters* can be used to append CGI parameters to the URL,
most useful for GET form submission.  Repeated parameters are allowed.  If
this block is used, the URL should /not/ contain any parameters, use one or
the other.

A HEREDOC called *content* can be used with POST or PUT to send an arbitrary block
of content to the remote server.

If the requested URL requires Basic or Digest authentication, the template can
include top level configuration parameters to supply a *user*, *password*, *realm*,
and hostname:port *location*.

A default user agent string of "EvergreenReactor/1.0" is used when sending requests.
This can be overridden using the top level *agent* setting.

Here is an example template that could be used by a definition attached to the
*bib.edit* hook:

[source,conf]
----
method   post # Valid values are post, get, put, delete, head
url      https://example.com/api/incoming-update
agent    MySpecialAgent/0.1

user     updater
password uPd4t3StufF
realm    "Secret area"
location example.com:443

<Headers>
  Accept-Language en
</Headers>

<Parameters>
  type bib
  id   [% target.id %]
</Parameters>

content <<MARC
[% target.marc %]
MARC
----





===== Documentation Now Uses the Antora Toolchain =====

The core Evergreen documentation under the `docs/` subdirectory
has been changed to use Antora, a documentation site generator
for AsciiDoc. The result of this change is the ability to generate
documentation for the `docs.evergreen-ils.org` website that is
searchable, easier to maintain, and readily installable on a
local Evergreen site if desired.

For instructions on how to build the documentation, consult
the file `README.adoc` under the `docs` directory.




==== Cataloging ====



===== Manage Authorities Angular Port =====

The Cataloging -> Manage Authorities interface has been ported to Angular.

New functionality includes displaying additional authority data, like create
and edit dates, etc.  It's also possible to view the list of linked bib
records.




===== MARC Batch Edit UI Angular Port =====

The MARC Batch Edit interface has been ported to Angular.




===== Preloaded Audio Icon and Search Format =====

A new search and icon format called Preloaded Audio now exists
using the following atttributes: itemtype i, item form q.  This
overlaps with the eAudio format.  If you want to exclude
preloaded audio from eAudio there is a script in the Administration
notes to exclude it.




===== Item Status Allows Pasting a List of Barcodes in csv Format =====

The item status input box will now accept a string of barcodes, separated with commas, as well as a single barcode.


===== Fix For "Blank" (Empty String) TCN Source =====

Previously, it was possible for sparsely-populated MARC records to be
saved with a TCN Source of '' (the "empty string"), which caused the
901 $b subfield to be void of data, causing errors when exporting
MARC records to such third-party programs as Zotero.

A site that has been running without this patch for a long time might want to
check how many bib records they have with an empty tcn_source:

----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biblio.record_entry WHERE deleted IS FALSE AND tcn_source = '';
----

Sites can fix the problem by issuing UPDATE statements to set the 901$b to a value
like 'AUTOGEN' or 'Unknown'. They should probably do it per-record, however, to
avoid locking the table in a huge commit.


==== Circulation ====



===== Booking Capture is now in Angular =====


The interface to capture resources for booking
reservations has been re-implemented in Angular.
Other booking screens, such as Pick Up and
Manage Reservations, now include an option to
re-print capture slips.

System administrators can now edit the template
for booking capture slips in Administration ->
Server administration -> Print templates.





===== New Fields for AutorenewNotify Event Template =====


Two new fields, `auto_renewal_remaining`, and `total_renewal_remaining` have
been added to the AutorenewNotify action/trigger event code.  They will
report the number of autorenewals and regular renewals, respectively,
remaining on the new circulation if renewed, or on the old circulation
if not renewed.  This is provided as a convenience to avoid possibly
inaccurate math in the template.  You may access them in the template via
the `udata`:

----
Automatic Renewals Remaining: [% udata.auto_renewal_remaining %]
Total Renewals Remaining: [% udata.total_renewal_remaining %]
----





===== Course Materials Module =====

This version of Evergreen includes an optional course materials module.
Like course reserves modules in other library software, this module
makes reserves collections more discoverable and easier to manage.
The module also provides similar functionality for library electronic
resources and open educational resources, whether they have been
cataloged or not.

To enable the course materials module, go to Administration ->
Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor. Find the setting
called "Opt Org Unit into the Course Materials Module".  Set it to
True for the org units that want to use the module.

To use the course materials module effectively, staff will need a
new permission called _MANAGE_RESERVES_.  By default, circulation
administrators will receive this permission.

Staff members with the _MANAGE_RESERVES_ permission can create
courses, attach materials to them, attach users to them, and
archive them when they are no longer needed.

When associating physical materials from the catalog to a
course, staff members can choose temporary item attributes.
These attributes will last until the course is archived or
the item is detached from the course, whichever happens
first.

Staff can also choose to associate electronic resources from
the catalog (which must have a transcendent bib source or
a located URI).  They can also create a brief bib record
to attach to the course from within the course materials
module.

Staff members can attach users to the course.  These users
can have either a public role (e.g. instructor) or private
roles (e.g. student).  The public roles will be displayed
in the OPAC.


If the module is enabled, the OPAC will include a course search
and a course browse option.


Libraries may also want to use this module to manage their
displays.  Each display can be treated as a course, and staff
can attach the items they wish to display to the course along
with the temporary attributes (e.g. a shelving location called
"On display").  When the display is over, staff members can
archive the course.




===== Hopeless Holds Interface =====

A new interface under Local Administration has been added called
Hopeless Holds.  Using a new Hopeless Date field on hold requests,
this interface gives staff a way to resolve issues with hold
requests that may have become unfulfillable or "hopeless".

The Hopeless Date is set for a given request by the hold targeter
whenever the potential items list for the hold is empty, or when
all potential items have a copy status that has been designated
as Hopeless Prone (a new boolean field on Item Statuses).





===== In-house use now records workstations =====

Evergreen now records the workstation along with each
in-house use.  Staff can now run reports on which
workstation created which in-house use.




===== Option to Make Effective Date of Checkin Sticky =====

Adds a checkbox to the Checkin screen that will make the backdate effective until logout.




===== Purge User Preferred Names =====

The new, user preferred name fields are now set to NULL in the
database when a user account is purged via the staff client or using
the actor.usr_delete function in the database.

To clear the preferred name fields from records that have already been
purged, run the following SQL update:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE actor.usr
SET pref_prefix = NULL,
    pref_first_given_name = NULL,
    pref_second_given_name = NULL,
    pref_family_name = NULL,
    pref_suffix = NULL,
    name_keywords = NULL
WHERE usrname ~ ('^' || id || '-PURGED')
AND NOT active
AND deleted
AND (
  pref_prefix IS NOT NULL OR
  pref_first_given_name IS NOT NULL OR
  pref_second_given_name IS NOT NULL OR
  pref_family_name IS NOT NULL OR
  pref_suffix IS NOT NULL OR
  name_keywords IS NOT NULL
);
----




===== Test Notification Method =====

Patrons and staff may request a test notification for a patron's default email address or SMS
number via the Patron Registration interface in the staff client or the OPAC preferences interface. The OPAC_LOGIN permissions are required to
request a notification. When a notification is sent, it will be sent to either the user's default email or default SMS number, depending on what was requested.

====== Upgrade Notes ======

This feature adds two new rows to action_trigger.event_definition, two into
action_trigger.hook, and six into action_trigger.environment.



===== Curbside Pickup =====

The Curbside Pickup feature in Evergreen provides an interface to help
facilitate contact-free pickup of library materials.  It provides a dedicated
interface in the staff client for library staff to track and manage curbside
pickup appointments and materials through the various stages of the process.
Staff can also schedule pickup appointments on behalf of patrons.  This feature
also allows patrons to schedule their own curbside pickup appointments in their
OPAC account, as well as inform the library when they have arrived and are
waiting for their materials.  

This is an extension of the existing holds functionality in Evergreen.  A hold
must be placed for an item to be eligible for curbside pickup.  After an item
has been captured for a hold and is available for pickup from the holds shelf,
a curbside pickup appointment can be scheduled to allow the materials to be
obtained in a contact-free transaction.

It can accommodate several different workflows depending on how the library
decides to implement curbside pickup services.  It can help library staff track and
checkout batches of items to be picked up curbside and help facilitate
communication between library staff and patrons.  It does not prescribe nor require a
specific workflow for curbside pickup.

It can be used alongside regular (i.e. inside the library) hold pickup.  Curbside pickup
can be an option offered patrons in addition to regular pickup or it can
be the primary pickup option depending on the library’s current service plan.

It assumes the library will have a staff member assigned to managing curbside
pickup throughout the day.

====== Library Settings ======

This feature adds the following library settings:

 * `circ.curbside`: whether to enable curbside appointments for
   picking up available hold requests. This defaults to off.
    
 * `circ.curbside.granularity`: interval between appointment slots. This
   defaults to 15 minutes.
 
 * `circ.curbside.max_concurrent`: how many appointments to permit per
   time slot.  This defaults to 10.

 * `circ.curbside.disable_patron_input`: if turned on, display scheduled
    and pending appointments in My Account in the public catalog but
    do not give the patron the ability to change them from My Account.
    This defaults to false, i.e., allowing patrons to modify appointments
    from My Account.

====== Notifications And Action Triggers ======

There are several new patron notice options related to curbside pickup.

When a patron’s holds are marked as ready for pickup in Evergreen, an email or
text/SMS notification can be sent to let them know that curbside pickup is an
option at their library.  This notice can be used to promote this service and
the default message will prompt patrons to log in to their OPAC account to
schedule an appointment or call the library to schedule an appointment.
Notice message is customizable.  The Trigger Event Definitions for this notice
are called:

 * Curbside offer Email notification, triggered by CurbsideSlot reactor on a
   definition attached to the hold available hook.
 * Curbside offer SMS notification, triggered by CurbsideSlot reactor on a
   definition attached to the hold available hook.

If a patron has scheduled a curbside pickup appointment, an email or text/SMS
notification can be sent to confirm the appointment.  It will also prompt them
to log into their account or call the library when they have arrived for their
pickup appointment.  The Trigger Event Definitions for this notice are called:

 * Curbside confirmation Email notification.
 * Curbside confirmation SMS notification.

Patrons can receive an email with a list of the items they checked out.  To
receive this notice patrons must have an email address associated with their
account and the option for “Email checkout receipts by default?” must be
selected in their account.  This is an existing notice in Evergreen that ties
in to the curbside pickup workflow.

There is another action trigger called “Trigger curbside offer events and
create a placeholder for the patron, where applicable”.  This action trigger
does not send a notice to patrons or staff.  It is a silent action behind the
scenes that initiates the curbside offer email or SMS notification described
above.  

====== Upgrade Notes ======

This feature adds a new OpenSRF service, `open-ils.curbside`, which must be
enabled and registered with the public router for the feature to function.

This feature adds no new staff permissions.



===== Allow Use of Adjusted Proximity for Age-protection =====

Introduces a new library setting to consult adjusted proximity for age-protected items at hold placement time.




==== Client ====



===== New Angular Staff Catalog Default =====

The experimental Angular staff catalog has been promoted to operate as the
default catalog in the browser staff client.  It will be used for all
catalog entry points, except for the menu entries for the traditional
catalog and any links within the traditional catalog.

====== Menu Changes ======

* Search -> 'Search The Catalog' now searches to new catalog.
* Cataloging -> 'Search The Catalog' now searches to new catalog.
* Cataloging -> 'Search The Catalog (Traditional)' searches the traditional
  TPAC-style catalog.
* Staff client splash page -> 'Search the catalog' inline form uses the
  new catalog.





===== Basket To Bucket Action Now Allows Adding To Shared Buckets =====

The Angular staff catalog's 'Add Basket to Bucket' action now
gives the user the option of adding the contents of the basket
to a shared bucket.


===== Angular catalog recall/force/part holds =====

The Angular staff catalog now has entry points for placing Recall,
Force, and Part-level holds.

For any item-level hold type, the user now has the option to cycle
between Item, Recall, and Force hold types.  The selected type affects
the full batch of holds.

For title-level holds, the user now has the option to select a part
as the hold target for each record in the list.  Part selection is
optional.


==== OPAC ====


===== New Bootstrap-based OPAC =====


This release includes a new experimental OPAC with a cleaner, more modern design.

To enable the new OPAC design, open the `/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf` file.

Find the following line:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates"
----

Add the following line directly below it:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates-bootstrap"
----

Be sure that, if you have any local customizations, that they are referenced below
this line.  This way, your customizations will still appear in the new OPAC design
(although they may need to be adjusted to better fit the new style).

You can also turn on the new OPAC for some virtual hosts only, by adding it to the
appropriate virtual host entry.  Be sure to reference the OILSWebTemplatePath for
the `templates-bootstrap` directory before referencing any local customizations
used by that virtual host.

To emphasize, the new OPAC skin is considered experimental for 3.6.x. There
are some discrepancies between its functionality and the functionality
present in the original "TPAC" skin. The Evergreen community aims to
resolve those discrepancies and make the Bootstrap skin become the default
OPAC for the Spring 2021 release (though the original TPAC skin will still
be available). Using the Bootstrap skin in production for 3.6 is at your own risk.




===== Enhanced Public Catalog Printing and Email =====

Evergreen now provides additional functionality for printing and emailing
bibliographic record and holdings information from the catalog, including
from an individual record or from a list or basket.

After selecting Print or Email, the user will be presented with a preview of
the printout or email, respectively.  From the preview users can chose to view
Brief or Full record information (Full includes holdings information) and how
records should be sorted (Author, Title, Publication Date).  Holdings
information can also be limited to a certain library.

Users can be required to log in to their OPAC account to send an email, or this
feature can be configured to allow sending an email without signing in to the
public catalog. If the option to allow emailing without signing in is enabled
(by turning on the new 'Allow record emailing without login' library setting),
user will be asked to solve an arithmetic CAPTCHA in order to send the email.

====== Administration ======

Two new interfaces have been added to Local Administration: Event Definition
Groups and Event Definition Group Members.  The Event Definition Groups defines
the various groups for Action Trigger Event Definitions -- currently Print
Record(s) or Email Record(s).  The Event Definition Group Members defines the
options within each group -- currently Brief or Full record information.

These two interfaces expose the infrastructure behind the new print and
email functionality and library staff will not need to make any changes to
these interfaces to use the existing print and email options.  The stock print
and email Action Trigger Event Definitions can be cloned and modified to
provide additional bibliographic format options.  After creating the custom
Event Definition, add it to the appropriate Event Definition Group (Print
Record or Email Record) and the new format will be available in the catalog.





===== Credit card payments using Stripe now on version 3 (Elements) =====

When Stripe payments are enabled, the public catalog will now
use version 3 of the Stripe client library, as well as its
Elements API for building the credit card form.  For
technical reasons, this more easily lends a site to PCI
compliance.

On the staff side, the credit card option is disabled for
Stripe, as that has not been implemented and in the past
would just give an error.




===== Improve Access to Library Info in OPAC =====

Adds the library's address, email, phone, and website link to the myopac patron account preferences page.




==== Reports ====



===== Combined Aged and Active Circulations Source Naming =====

A recent improvement to aid web client data retrieval
speed resulted in a new reports source that was named
nearly identically to a long-existing one, and both
were appearing in the "Core Sources" section of reports.
The newer source has been renamed for clarity and removed
from the core sources to prevent confusion:

 * "Combined Aged and Active Circulations" is now named "Combined Aged and Active Circulations (Slim Version)"
   and is removed from the Core Sources.
 * "Combined Aged and Active Circulations", which contains more linkages to other data sources, remains in the
   Core Sources list.




===== Reports Subtotals =====

Reports now allow group subtotals and grand totals.  By checking the
new "Calculate grouping subtotals" checkbox under "Output Options",
a new unlabeled row or column is created with the subtotals for each
grouping and an unlabeled grand total row or column.

This takes advantage of PostreSQL's built-in ROLLUP feature.  See the
PostgreSQL documentation for details:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS

An example of a report that could use this new feature is
one based on the Circulation source with the following fields:

 * Circulation -> Checkout / Renewal Library -> Short (Policy) Name (Raw Data)
 * Circulation -> Checkout Date/Time (Year)
 * Circulation -> Shelving Location -> Name (Raw Data)
 * Circulation -> Circ ID (Count Distinct)

Turning on the "Calculate grouping subtotals" checkbox would make
the report show subtotals for each combination of
short name, checkout year, and shelving location name.




==== SIP ====



===== Allow Username in Patron ID =====

Evergreen now accepts a patron's username in the SIP2 Patron ID field
(AA) in addition to the barcode.  This modification is useful for
vendors, such as Overdrive, who can accept a user's username.
Additionally, it is easier for a patron to find and remember their
username over their barcode.

The new feature determines if the value in the Patron ID field is a
barcode or username by comparing the field value against the
`opac.barcode_regex` setting for the organizational unit of the logged
in SIP2 account as configured in the oils_sip.xml file.  This is
similar to what the OPAC does when a patron logs in.

This feature requires activation.  To activate, uncomment (or add) the
following line in the oils_sip.xml configuration file and change the
value from 'false' to 'true'.

[source,xml]
----
<option name='support_patron_username_login' value='true' />
----
