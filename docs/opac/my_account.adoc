In the *My Account* -> *Account Summary* page, you can see when your account
expires and your total number of items checked out, items on hold, and items
ready for pickup. In addition, the Account Summary page lists your current fines
and payment history.


Items Checked Out 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[my account, items checked out]

Users can manage items currently checked out, like renew specific items. Users
can also view overdue items and see how many renewals they have remaining for
specific item.

As of Evergreen version 2.9, sorting of selected columns is available in the
 _Items Checked Out_ and _Check Out History_ pages. Clicking on the appropriate
 column heads sorts the contents from "ascending" to "descending" to "no sort".
(The "no sort" restores the original list as presented in the screen.) The sort 
indicator (an up or down arrow) is placed to the right of the column head, as 
appropriate.

Within *Items Checked Out* -> *Current Items Checked Out*, the following column
 headers can be sorted: _Title_, _Author_, _Renewals Left_, _Due Date_,
_Barcode_, and _Call Number_.

Within *Items Checked Out* -> *Check Out History*, the following column headers 
can be sorted: _Title_, _Author_, _Checkout Date_, _Due Date_, _Date Returned_, 
_Barcode_, and _Call Number_

[NOTE]
==========
To protect patron privacy, the Check Out History will be completely blank unless the patron has previously opted in under the _Account Preferences_ tab, in the _Search and History Preferences_
area.
==========


Holds
^^^^^ 

indexterm:[my account, holds]

From *My Account*, patrons can see *Items on Hold* and *Holds History* and
manage items currently being requested. In *Holds* -> *Items on Hold*, the 
content shown can be sorted by clicking on the following column headers:

Actions include: 

* Suspend - set a period of time during which the hold will not become active, 
such as during a vacation

* Cancel - remove the hold request 

Edit options include: 

* Change pick up library 
* Change the _Cancel unless filled by_ date, also known as the hold expiration 
date

area.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[my account, account preferences]

From here you can manage display preferences including your *Personal

Patron Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Patron Message Center provides a way for libraries to communicate with 
patrons through messages that can be accessed through the patron's OPAC account.
 Library staff can create messages manually by adding an OPAC visible Patron 
Note to an account.  Messages can also be automatically generated through an 
Action Trigger event.  Patrons can access and manage messages within their OPAC 
account.  See Circulation - Patron Record - Patron Message Center for more 
information on adding messages to patron accounts.

*Viewing Patron Messages in the OPAC*

Patrons will see a new tab for *Messages* in their OPAC account, as well as a 
notification of *Unread Messages* in the account summary.

image::media/message_center11.PNG[Message Center 11]

Patrons will see a list of the messages from the library by clicking on the 
*Messages* tab.

image::media/message_center10.PNG[Message Center 10]

Patrons can click on a message *Subject* to view the message.  After viewing the
message, it will automatically be marked as read.  Patrons have the options to 
mark the message as unread and to delete the message.

image::media/message_center12.PNG[Message Center 12]

NOTE: Patron deleted messages will still appear in the patron's account in the 
staff client under Other -> Message Center.

Reservations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When patrons place a reservation for a particular item at a particular time,
they can check on its status using the *Reservations* tab.

After they initially place a reservation, its status will display as _Reserved_.
After staff capture the reservation, the status will change to _Ready for Pickup_.
After the patron picks up the reservation, the status will change to _Checked Out_.
Finally, after the patron returns the item, the reservation will be removed from
the list.

[NOTE]
====================
This interface pulls its timezone from the Library
Settings Editor.  Make sure that you have a timezone
listed for your library in the Library Settings Editor
before using this feature.
