Batch Actions from Search
-------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The public catalog and staff interface display checkboxes on the search results pages, both for bibliographic records and metarecord constituents.  Selecting one or more titles with these checkboxes adds the titles to a basket, which is viewable on the search bar as an icon.  Users can then take a variety of actions on titles within the basket:  place holds, print or email title details, add the items to a permanent list (from the public catalog) or add the titles to a bucket (from the staff interface).

Checkboxes appear to the left of the number of each result.

If you want to place the entire page of results on the list, click the _Select All_ checkbox at the top of the results list. 
+
 
. Select one or more titles from the results list by clicking on the checkboxes.

Selected titles are automatically added to the basket. A link above the results list tracks the number of titles selected and added to the basket.

Additional Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basket used to be called a *Temporary List* in previous versions of Evergreen.

Titles also may be added from the detailed bibliographic record with the _Add to Basket_ link.

Javascript must be enabled for checkboxes to appear in the public catalog; however, users can still add items to the basket and perform batch actions without Javascript.

The default limit on the number of basket titles is 500; however, a template config.tt2 setting (+ctx.max_basket_size+) can be used to set a different limit.  When the configured limit is reached, checkboxes are disabled unless or until some titles in the basket are removed.

The permanent list management page within a patron’s account also now includes batch print and email actions.
