My Lists
--------

The *My Lists* feature replaces the bookbag feature that was available in versions prior to 2.2.  The *My Lists* feature is a part of the Template Toolkit OPAC that is available in version 2.2.  This feature enables you to create temporary and permanent lists; create and edit notes for items in lists; place holds on items in lists; and share lists via RSS feeds and CSV files.

5) Items are added to a temporary list.  Your temporary list appears at the bottom of the screen.

6) The *Actions for these items* menu on the right side of the screen demonstrates the actions that you can apply to this list.  You can place holds on items in your temporary list; remove items from the list; or move selected items to a permanent list.  

To place a hold or remove items from the list, check the box adjacent to the title of the item, and select the desired function.

To move selected items into an existing list, check the box adjacent to the title, and highlight the list in which you will store the item.

*Local Call Number in My Lists*

As of Evergreen version 2.4, when a title is added to a list in the TPAC, a local call number will be displayed in the list to assist patrons in locating the physical item.  Evergreen will look at the following locations to identify the most relevant call number to display in the list:  

1)	Physical location - the physical library location where the search takes place

2)	Preferred library - the Preferred Search Location, which is set in patron OPAC account Search and History Preferences, or the patron's Home Library

3)	Search library - the search library or org unit that is selected in the OPAC search interface

The call number that is displayed will be the most relevant call number to the searcher.  If the patron is searching at the library, Evergreen will display a call number from that library location.  If the patron is not searching at a library, but is logged in to their OPAC account, Evergreen will display a call number from their Home Library or Preferred Search Location.  If the patron is not searching at the library and is not signed in to their OPAC account, then Evergreen will display a call number from the org unit, or library, that they choose to search in the OPAC search interface.

The local call number and associated library location will appear in the list:
