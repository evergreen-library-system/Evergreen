Kids OPAC
---------

The Kids OPAC (KPAC) is a public catalog search that was designed for children 
and teens.  Colorful menu items,large buttons, and simple navigation make this 
an appealing search interface for kids.  Librarians will appreciate the flexible 
configuration of the KPAC.  Librarians can create links to canned search results 
for kids and can apply these links by branch.  The KPAC uses the same infrastructure 
as the Template Toolkit OPAC (TPAC), the adult catalog search, so you can easily 
extend the KPAC using the code that already exists in the TPAC.  Finally, third 
party content, such as reader reviews, can be integrated into the KPAC.

Choose a Skin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two skins, or design interfaces, have been created for the KPAC.  The KPAC was 
designed to run multiple skins on a single web server.  A consortium, then, could 
allow each library system to choose a skin for their patrons.


*Monster Skin:*


In this skin, the search bar shares the top panel with a playful monster.  The 
search grid appears beneath the search bar.  Help and Login links appear in bold 
colors at the top right of the interface although you can customize these with CSS.  
After you login, the Login button disappears.

*Alternate Skin:*

In this skin, the search bar is the focal point of the top panel and is centered 
on the screen.  The search grid appears beneath the search bar.  Help and Login 
links appear at the top right of the interface. You can customize the appearance 
and position of these links with CSS.  After you login, the user name is displayed 
in the top right corner, and the Login link becomes an option to Logout.

Search the Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can search the catalog using only the search bar, the search grid, or the search 
bar and the collection drop down menu.


*Search using the Search Bar*

To search the catalog from the home page, enter text into the search bar in the 
center of the main page, or enter text into the search bar to the right of the 
results on a results page.  Search indices are configurable, but the default search 
indices include author, title and (key)word.

You can use this search bar to search the entire catalog, or, using the configuration 
files, you can apply a filter so that search queries entered here retrieve records 
that meet specific criteria, such as child-friendly copy locations or MARC audience 
codes. 


*Search using the Grid*

From the home page, you can search the catalog by clicking on the grid of icons.  
An icon search can link to an external web link or to a canned search.  For example, 
the icon, Musical Instruments, could link to the results of a catalog search on 
the subject heading, Musical instruments.  

The labels on the grid of icons and the content that they search are configurable 
by branch.  You can use the grid to search the entire catalog, or, using the 
configuration files, you can apply a filter so that search queries entered here 
retrieve records associated with specific criteria, such as child-friendly copy 
locations or MARC audience codes.

You can add multiple layers of icons and searches to your grid:

*Search using the Search Bar and the _Collection_ Drop Down Menu*

On the search results page, a search bar and drop down menu appear on the right 
side of the screen.  You can enter a search term and into the search bar and select 
a collection from the drop down menu to search these configured collections.  
Configured collections might provide more targeted searching for your audience 
than a general catalog search.  For example, you could create collections by shelving 
location or by MARC audience code.

Using any search method, the search results display in the center of the screen.  
Brief information displays beneath each title in the initial search result.  The 
brief information that displays, such as title, author, or publication information, 
is configurable.

For full details on a title, click *More Info*.  The full details displays the 
configured fields from the title record and copy information.  Click *Show more 
copies* to display up to fifty results.  Use the breadcrumbs at the top to trace 
your search history.

Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration files allow you to define labels for canned searches in the icon 
grid, determine how icons lead users to new pages, and define whether those icons 
are canned searches or links to external resources.  Documentation describing how 
to use the configruation files is available in the Evergreen respository.
