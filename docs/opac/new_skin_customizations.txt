Creating a New Skin: the Bare Minimum
=====================================

When you adopt the TPAC as your catalog, you must create a new skin. This
involves a combination of overriding template files and setting Apache
directives to control the look and feel of your customized TPAC.

Apache directives
-----------------
There are a few Apache directives and environment variables of note for
customizing TPAC behavior. These directives should generally live within a
`<vhost>` section of your Apache configuration.

* `OILSWebDefaultLocale` specifies which locale to display when a user lands
   on a page in the TPAC and has not chosen a different locale from the TPAC
   locale picker. The following example shows the `fr_ca` locale being added
   to the locale picker and being set as the default locale:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PerlAddVar OILSWebLocale "fr_ca"
PerlAddVar OILSWebLocale "/openils/var/data/locale/fr-CA.po"
PerlAddVar OILSWebDefaultLocale "fr-CA"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
* `physical_loc` is an Apache environment variable that sets the default
  physical location, used for setting search scopes and determining the order
  in which copies should be sorted. The following example demonstrates the
  default physical location being set to library ID 104:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SetEnv physical_loc 104
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customizing templates
---------------------
When you install Evergreen, the TPAC templates include many placeholder images,
text, and links. You should override most of these to provide your users with a
custom experience that matches your library.  Following is a list of templates
that include placeholder images, text, or links that you should override.

NOTE: All paths are relative to `/openils/var/templates/opac`

* `parts/config.tt2`: contains many configuration settings that affect the
  behavior of the TPAC, including:
  ** hiding the *Place Hold* button for available items
  ** enabling RefWorks support for citation management
  ** adding OpenURL resolution for electronic resources
  ** enabling Google Analytics tracking for your TPAC
  ** displaying the "Forgot your password?" prompt
  ** controlling the size of cover art on the record details page
  ** defining which facets to display, and in which order
  ** controlling basic and advanced search options
* `parts/footer.tt2` and `parts/topnav_links.tt2`: contains customizable
  links. Defaults like 'Link 1' will not mean much to your users!
* `parts/homesearch.tt2`: holds the large Evergreen logo on the home page
  of the TPAC. Substitute your library's logo, or if you are adventurous,
  create a "most recently added items" carousel... and then share your
  customization with the Evergreen community.
* `parts/topnav_logo.tt2`: holds the small Evergreen logo that appears on the
  top left of every page in the TPAC. You will also want to remove or change
  the target of the link that wraps the logo and leads to the
  http://evergreen-ils.org[Evergreen site].
* `parts/login/form.tt2`: contains some assumptions about terminology and
  examples that you might prefer to change to be more consistent with your own
  site's existing practices. For example, you may not use 'PIN' at your library
  because you want to encourage users to use a password that is more secure than
  a four-digit number.
* `parts/login/help.tt2`: contains links that point to http://example.com,
  images with text on them (which is not an acceptable practice for
  accessibility reasons), and promises of answers to frequently asked questions
  that might not exist at your site.
* `parts/login/password_hint.tt2`: contains a hint about your users' password
  on first login that is misleading if your library does not set the initial
  password for an account to the last four digits of the phone number associated
  with the account.
* `parts/myopac/main_refund_policy.tt2`: describes the policy for refunds for
  your library.
* `parts/myopac/prefs_hints.tt2`: suggests that users should have a valid email
  on file so they can receive courtesy and overdue notices. If your library
  does not send out email notices, you should edit this to avoid misleading your
  users.
* `parts/css/fonts.tt2`: defines the font sizes for the TPAC in terms of one
  base font size, and all other sizes derived from that in percentages. The
  default is 12 pixels, but http://goo.gl/WfNkE[some design sites] strongly
  suggest a base font size of 16 pixels. Perhaps you want to try '1em' as a
  base to respect your users' preferences. You only need to change one number
  in this file if you want to experiment with different options for your users.
* `parts/css/colors.tt2`: chances are your library's official colors do not
  match Evergreen's wall of dark green. This file defines the colors in use in
  the standard Evergreen template. In theory you should be able to change just
  a few colors and everything will work, but in practice you will need to
  experiment to avoid light-gray-on-white low-contrast combinations.
