Using the Public Access Catalog
-------------------------------

Basic Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[OPAC]

From the OPAC home, you can conduct a basic search of all materials owned by all libraries in your Evergreen system.

This search can be as simple as typing keywords into the search box and clicking the _Search_ button. Or you can make your search more precise by limiting your search by fields to search, material type or library location.

indexterm:[search box]

The _Homepage_ contains a single search box for you to enter search terms. You can get to the _Homepage_ at any time by clicking the _Another Search_ link from the leftmost link on the bar above your search results in the catalogue, or you can enter a search anywhere you see a search box.

You can select to search by:

indexterm:[search, keyword]
indexterm:[search, title]
indexterm:[search, journal title]
indexterm:[search, author]
indexterm:[search, subject]
indexterm:[search, series]
indexterm:[search, bib call number]

* *Keyword* —finds the terms you enter anywhere in the entire record for an item, including title, author, subject, and other information.

* *Title* —finds the terms you enter in the title of an item.

* *Journal Title* — finds the terms you enter in the title of a serial bib record.

* *Author* —finds the terms you enter in the author of an item.

* *Subject* —finds the terms you enter in the subject of an item. Subjects are categories assigned to items according to a system such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings.

* *Series* —finds the terms you enter in the title of a multi-part series.

* *Bib Call Number* —finds the terms you enter in the call number field of a bib record. 


[TIP]
=============
To search an item copy call number, if different from _Bib Call Number_, use <<numeric_search, _Advanced Search: Numeric_>> 
=============

Formats
^^^^^^^

You can limit your search by formats based on MARC fixed field type:

indexterm:[formats, books]
indexterm:[formats, audiobooks]
indexterm:[formats, video]
indexterm:[formats, music]


* *All Books*
* *All Music*
* *Audiocassette music recording*
* *Blue-ray* 
* *Braille*

Libraries
+++++++++

If you are using a catalogue in a library or accessing a library’s online catalogue from its homepage, the search will return items for your local library. If your library has multiple branches, the result will display items available at your branch and all branches of your library system separately.


Advanced Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced searches allow users to perform more complex searches by providing more options. Many kinds of searches can be performed from the _Advance Search_ screen. You can access by clicking _Advanced Search_ on the catalogue _Homepage_ or search results screen.

The available search options are the same as on the basic search. But you may use one or many of them simultaneously. If you want to combine more than three search options, use _Add Search Row_ button to add more search input rows. Clicking the _X_ button will close the search input row.


Sort Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[advanced search, sort results]

By default, the search results are in order of greatest to least relevance, see <<order_of_results, Order of Results>>. In the sort results menu you may select to order the search results by relevance, title, author, or publication date.


Search Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[advanced search, search library]

The current search library is displayed under _Search Library_ drop down menu. Be default it is your library. The search returns results for your local library only. If your library system has multiple branches, use the _Search Library_ box to select different branches or the whole library system.


Limit to Available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[advanced search, limit to available]


This checkbox is at the bottom line of _Search Library_. Select _Limit to Available_ to limit by item’s current circulation status. Titles without available items in the library will not be displayed.


Search Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[advanced search, search filters]

You can filter your search by _Item Type_, _Item Form_, _Language_, _Audience_, _Video Format_, _Bib Level_, _Literary Form_, _Search Library_, and _Publication Year_. Publication year is inclusive. For example, if you set _Publication Year_ Between 2005 and 2007, your result items will be published in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

For each filter type, you may select multiple criteria by holding down the _CTRL_ key as you click on the options. If nothing is selected for a filter, the search will return results as though all options are selected.


anchor:numeric_search[]
indexterm:[advanced search, numeric search]

Numeric Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have details on the exact item you wish to search for, use the _Numeric Search_ tab on the advanced search page. Use the drop-down menu to select your search by _ISBN_, _ISSN_, _Bib Call Number_, _Call Number (Shelf Browse)_, _LCCN_, _TCN_, or _Item Barcode_. Enter the information and then click the _Search_ button.

Expert Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[advanced search, expert search]

If you are familiar with the MARC system, you may search by tag in the _Expert Search_ option on the left of the screen. Enter the three-digit tag number, the subfield if relevant, and the value or text that corresponds to the tag. For example, to search by publisher name, enter 260 b Random House. To search several tags simultaneously, use the _Add Row_ option. Click _Submit_ to run the search. 

Search Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[searchtips, AND operator]
indexterm:[searchtips, boolean]


You do not need to enter author's last name first, nor do you need an exact title or subject heading. Evergreen is also forgiving about plurals and alternate verb endings, so if you enter _dogs_, Evergreen will also find items with _dog_. 

* Do not use an _AND_ operator to join search terms. 

** An _AND_ operator is automatically used to join all search terms. So, a search for _golden compass_ will search for entries that contain both _golden_ *and* _compass_. 

** Boolean operators such as _and_, _or_, _not_ are not considered special and are searched for like any other word. So, a search for _golden and compass_ will not return the title _golden compass_. Putting it another way, there are no _stop_ words that are automatically ignored by the search engine. So, a title search for the _and or not_ of (and in any order) yields a list of titles with those words. 

* Don’t worry about white space, exact punctuation, or capitalization. 

. White spaces before or after a word are ignored. So, search for _golden compass_ gives the same results as a search for _golden compass_. 

. A double dash or a colon between words is reduced to a blank space. So, a title search for _golden:compass_ or _golden -- compass_ is equivalent to _golden compass_. 

. Punctuation marks occurring within a word are removed; the exception is \_. So, a title search for _gol_den com_pass_ gives no result. 

. Diacritical marks, &, or | located anywhere in the search term are removed. Words or letters linked together by .(dot) are joined together without the dot. So, a search for _go|l|den & comp.ass_ is equivalent to _golden compass_. 

. Upper and lower case letters are equivalent. So, _Golden Compass_ is the same as _golden compass_. 

* Enter your search words in any order. So, a search for _compass golden_ gives the same results as a search for _golden compass_. Adding more search words gives fewer and more specific results. 

** This is also true for author searches. Both _David Suzuki_ and _Suzuki, David_ will return results for the same author. 

* Use specific search terms. Evergreen will search for the words you specify, not the meanings, so choose search terms that are likely to appear in an item description. For example, the search _luxury hotels_ will produce more 
relevant results than _nice places_ to stay. 

* Search for an exact phrase using double-quotes. For example ``golden compass''. 

** The order of words is important for an exact phrase search. _golden compass_ is different than _compass golden_. 

** White space, punctuation and capitalization are removed from exact phrases as described above. So a phrase retains its search terms and its relative order, but not special characters and not case. 

** Two phrases are joined by and, so a search for _"golden compass"_ _"dark materials"_ is equivalent to _golden compass_ *and* _dark materials_. 

** To prevent <<stemming,stemming>>, use double quotes around a single word or a phrase. So, a search for parenting will also return results for _parental_ but a search for _parenting_ will not.

* Truncation
Words may be right-hand truncated using an asterisk. Use a single asterisk * to truncate any number of characters.
(example: environment* agency)


Search Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

anchor:stemming[]

Stemming 
^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search methodology, stemming]

A search for _dogs_ will also return hits with the word dog and a search for parenting will return results with the words parent and parental. This is because the search uses stemming to help return the most relevant results. That 
is, words are reduced to their stem (or root word) before the search is performed. 

The stemming algorithm relies on common English language patterns - like verbs ending in _ing_ - to find the stems. This is more efficient that looking up each search term in a dictionary and usually produces desirable results. However, it also means the search will sometimes reduce a word to an incorrect stem and cause unexpected results. To prevent a word or phrase from stemming, put it in double-quotes. 

Understanding how stemming works can help you to create more relevant searches, but it is usually best not to anticipate how a search term will be stemmed. For example, searching for _gold compass_ does not return for _golden compass_ because the search does not recognize _gold_ as a stem of _golden_. 


anchor:order_of_results[]

Order of Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search methodology, order of results]

By default, the results are listed in order of relevance, similar to a search engine like Google. The relevance is determined using a number of factors, including how often and where the search terms appear in the item description, 
and whether the search terms are part of the title, subject, author, or series. The results which best match your search are returned first rather than results appearing in alphabetical or chronological order. 

In the _Advanced Search_ screen, you may select to order the search results by relevance, title, author, or publication date before you start the search. You can also re-order your search results using the _Sort Results_ dropdown list on 
the search result screen.


Search URL
~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[search URL]

When performing a search or clicking on the details links, Evergreen constructs a GET request url with the parameters of the search. The url for searches and details in Evergreen are persistent links in that they can be saved, shared and used later.

Here is a basic search URL structure:


+++[hostname]+++/eg/opac/results?query=[search term]&**qtype**=keyword&fi%3Aitem_type=&**locg**=[location id]

locg Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the id of the search location. It is an integer and maches the id of the location the user selected in the location drop down menu.

qtype Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The _qtype_ parameter in the URL represents the search type values and represent one of the following search or request types:


* Keyword 
* Title
* Journal Title
* Author
* Subject
* Series
* Bib Call Number


These match the options in the search type drop-down box.

Sorting
^^^^^^^

The _sort_ parameter sorts the results on one of these criteria.
• sort=pubdate (publication date) - chronological order
• sort=titlesort - Alphabetical order
• sort=authorsort - Alphabetical order on family name first

To change the sort direction of the resutls, the _sort_ paremeter value has the ".descending" suffix added to it.

* sort=titlesort.descending
* sort=authorsort.descending
* sort=pubdate.descending

In the absence of the _sort_ parameter, the search results default to sorting by relevance.


Search Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[search results]

The search results are a list of relevant works from the catalogue. If there are many results, they are divided into several pages. At the top of the list, you can see the total number of results and go back and forth between the pages 
by clicking the links that say _Previous_ or _Next_ on top or bottom of the list. You can also click on the adjacent results page number listed. These page number links allow you to skip to that results page, if your search results needed multiple pages to display. Here is an example: 


image::media/catalogue-3.png[catalogue-3]

Brief information about the title, such as author, edition, publication date, etc. is displayed under each title. The icons beside the brief information indicate formats such as books, audio books, video recordings, and other formats. Have your mouse over the icon, text explanation will show up in a small pop-up box. 

Clicking a title goes to the title details. Clicking an author searches all works by the author. If you want to place a hold on the title, click _Place Hold_ beside the format icons.

On the top right, there is a _Limit to Available_ checkbox. Checking this box will filter out those titles with no available copies in the library or libraries at the moment. Usually you will see your search results are re-displayed with fewer titles. 

The _Sort by_ dropdown list is found at the top of the search results, beside the _Show More Details_ link. Clicking an entry on the list will re-sort your search results accordingly.


Facets: Subjects, Authors, and Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, facets: subjects, authors, and series]

At the left, you may see a list of _Facets of Subjects_, _Authors_, and _Series_. Selecting any one of these links filters your current search results using that subject, author, or series to narrow done your current results. The facet filters can be undone by clicking the link a second time, thus returning your original results before the facet was activated. 

image::media/catalogue-5.png[catalogue-5]


Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, availability]

The number of available copies and total copies are displayed under each search result's call number. If you are using a catalogue inside a library or accessing a library’s online catalogue from its homepage, you will see how many copies are available in the library under each title, too. If the library belongs to a multi-branch library system you will see an extra row under each title showing how many copies are available in all branches.


image::media/catalogue-6.png[catalogue-6]

image::media/catalogue-7.png[catalogue-7]

You may also click the _Show More Details_ link at the top of the results page, next to the _Limit to available items_ check box, to view each search result's copies' individual call number, status, and shelving location. 


Viewing a record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, viewing a record]

Click on a search result's title to view a detailed record of the title, including descriptive information, location and availability, current holds, and options for placing holds, add to my list, and print/email. 

image::media/catalogue-8.png[catalogue-8]


Details
^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, details]

The record shows details such as the cover image, title, author, publication information, and an abstract or summary, if available. 

Near the bottom of the record, the copy summary shows how many copies are at the library or libraries you have selected, and whether they are available or checked out. It also displays the _Call Number_ and _Shelving Location_ for locating the item on the shelves. You can click _Shelf Browser_ to view items appearing near the current item on the library shelves. Often this is a good way to browse for similar items. You can select _Table of Contents_ to see the book’s table of contents online (if available). You can select _MARC Record_ to display the record in MARC format. You can also select _Awards, Reviews, & Suggested Reads_ and _Additional Content_ to see more details (if available).   


Placing Holds 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, placing holds]

Holds can be placed on either title results or search results page. If the item is available, it will be pulled from the shelf and held for you. If all copies at your local library are checked out, you will be placed on a waiting list and 
you will be notified when items become available. 

On title details page, you can select the _Place Hold_ link in the upper right corner of the record to reserve the item. You will need your library account user name and password. You may choose to be notified by phone or email.

In the example below, the phone number in your account will automatically show up. Once you select the Enable phone notifications for this hold checkbox, you can supply a different phone number for this hold only. The notification method will be selected automatically if you have set it up in your account references. But you still have a chance to re-select on this screen. You may also suspend the hold temporarily by checking the Suspend box. Click the _Help_ beside it for details. 

You can view and cancel a hold at anytime. Before your hold is captured, which means an item has been held waiting for you to pick up, you can edit, suspend or activate it. You need log into your patron <<my_account,My Account>> to do it. From your account you can also set up an _Cancel if not filled by_ date for your hold. _Cancel if not filled by_ date means after this date, even though your hold has not been fulfilled you do not need the item anymore.


image::media/catalogue-9.png[catalogue-9]

Going back 
^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[search results, going back]

When you are viewing a specific record, you can always go back to your title list by clicking the link _Search Results_ on the top right or left bottom of the page. 

image::media/catalogue-10.png[catalogue-10]

You can start a new search at any time by entering new search terms in the search box at the top of the page, or by selecting the _Another Search_ or _Advanced Search_ links in the left-hand sidebar.
