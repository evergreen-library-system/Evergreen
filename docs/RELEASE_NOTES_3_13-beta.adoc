= Acquisitions =


This work represents the last major part of the multi-year Angular Acquisitions
project. The Invoices and Claims interfaces have been reimplemented in Angular
and have had several improvements, including scoping claim policy actions;
adding a summary to invoices recording funds and charges; integration with
Acquisitions Search; and other bugfixes.

The MARC Federated search and Z39.50 search interfaces have also been
reimplemented in Angular, including several bugfixes associated with Z39.50
search in particular.

A new component is also added for the MARC Batch Import/Export (Vandelay) and
Load MARC Order Records interfaces that allows for background processing of
record imports. There is a checkbox in each of these interfaces labeled
_Request background import_ and a field to enter an email address. If a user
selects background import, they can navigate away from the import screen while
the import continues processing in the background. If they enter an email
address, they will recieve a notification when the import is complete. Status
and history of background imports for each user can be seen in the MARC Batch
Import/Export interface under the new _Background Imports_ tab.



== Fixes for SFTP Transfer of EDI Order Data ==

With more vendors requiring Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for sending and receiving acquisitions data via EDI, it was https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/2040514[discovered that the SFTP mechanism in the Evergreen acquisitions module did not work as well as it should].

This release repairs the SFTP transfer mechanism so that it should work with most vendors who require usernames and passwords for authentication.

To switch from FTP to SFTP, edit the EDI account's host entry to begin with "sftp://" instead of "ftp://".  Check with your EDI vendor before making this change.  They may have additional requirements.

=== New Prerequisite Perl Modules ===

This fix introduces two new required Perl modules for Evergreen: `Net::SFTP::Foreign` and `IO::Pty`.  These can be installed by running the prerequisite installation for your Linux distribution.  Please see the https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/install/README_3_12.html#_installing_prerequisites[Evergreen installation instructions].



= Administration =


== Support Scripts: marc_export check for required IDs ==

The *marc_export* script will now exit if it expects to be
passed IDs and they are not found.  Previously it would
continue on as if you wanted all records in the system in 
that situation. 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1329872[Bug #1329872]



= Architecture =


== IDL Improvements and Clean Up ==

The IDL (fm_IDL.xml) has undergone improvement and clean up.

More fields have been marked required.  Required fields are that those
that come from a database table, have a "NOT NULL" constraint in the
schema, and do not have a default value assigned in the database.
This change has the advantage of making it easier for the Angular
staff client to identify required fields and prevent bad data from
being entered in many interfaces.

Classes that are read-only and virtual were ignored, since they cannot
be updated.  Virtual fields were also skipped for similar reasons.

No attempt was made to validate whether or not existing required
fields should be required.  If a field was required before these
changes, it should still be required now.

Line wrap and spacing have been updated to match the output of
libxml2.

Spaces used for indentation have been replaced with tabs using the vim
and Emacs setting of 4 spaces per tab.

Two schema validation errors have been corrected:

 1. A typo of "relteype" was corrected to "reltype."

 2. An extra "retrieve" permissions entry was removed from the asc
 class.

If you have custom IDL entries, you will want to make sure that you
merge with this update and check for conflicts.  It would be a good
idea to validate your merged IDL with the schema file:

----
xmllint --schema Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xsd Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xml
----

For maintaining future compatibility and ease of merging, you may want
to ensure that your custom IDL entries follow the above formatting
guidelines.



= Cataloging =


== Holdings Editor Batch Action &lt;None&gt; Option Restored ==

The &lt;None&gt; option has been restored for prefix and suffix fields
in the Holdings Editor's Batch Actions.  See
[Lp 1998413](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1998413).



== Patron View Discovery Layer URL ==

A new org unit setting configures the discovery layer URL opened
by the Patron View button on a staff catalog record.
The placeholder to include for the record ID is {eg_record_id}.

Example: `https://example.com/Record/{eg_record_id}`



= Client =


== Improve Button Colors in Staff Client ==

Yellow is no longer used as a button color in the staff client
for normal actions such as closing dialogs that do not involve
a condition that actually requrires a warning.

Instead, light grey is used as a default color for buttons
that do secondary actions, with a variant that includes red
upon hover or activation for actions that remove data or clear
form input.

=== Developer Notes ===

The `btn-warning` CSS class should be avoided in the staff interface
unless needed for actions that truly require a warning. Instead,
`btn-normal` should be used for secondary actions such as closing
a dialog and `btn-destroy` for actions that would remove or clear
data.


== Staff client: Library Group and Shelving Location Group search ==

A new dropdown is available when in-scope, including globally available,
Library Groups are present.  In-scope Shelving Location Groups can also
optionally be presented in this dropdown.  Scoping of Library Groups and
Shelving Location Groups, in this interface component, is based on and
effectively replaces the selected organizational unit, such that the Library
Group or Shelving Location Group takes the place of a branch of the
organizational hierarchy for location filtering.

When a Library Group or Shelving Location Group is seleced from this new
component, specific Shelving Location selection is disabled because those
filtering axes are mutually exclusive.

=== Enabling and disabling Shelving Location Group inclusion ===

This developement adds a new Global Flag called
staff.search.shelving_location_groups_with_lassos ("Staff Catalog Search:
Display shelving location groups with library groups").  If disabled, Shelving
Location Groups will not be included in new filter dropdown.  This is provided
as a way to entirely separate Shelving Location Groups from this interface
change in future parallel development, if desired, on an instance-by-instance
basis.




= OPAC =


== Creating carousels from item bucket or item status ==

The item status interfaces has a new option:
"Create Carousel from Selected Items".  The item bucket
interface has a new option: "Create Carousel from Bucket".
Both of these options allow users to create carousels, which
can later be edited as needed in the Carousels Admin interface.

One use case for the new item bucket interface is to allow
libraries to showcase existing item buckets that they have
created for a holiday, program, or display.



== Allow Patrons to Edit Preferred Name ==

This change builds upon the existing staff client 
preferred name functionality to allow patrons to 
edit their preferred names directly through OPAC > 
My Account > Preferences > Personal Information. 


= Reports =


== Angular Reporter rewrite ==

All existing Reporter interfaces, except for the actual report output, have
been reimplemented using Angular to match the rest of the staff client.  In
addition to the updated and improved interfaces, additional functionality is
now available:

  * Field display order and output sort order are now separated, and can be controlled independently
  * Nullability has been simplified, presenting the template creator with a choice between INNER join (linked required on both tables) and LEFT join (only the "parent" table is required to have a contributing row)
  * Staff can see the list of Reports that make use of a Template, and the list of Outputs that are generated from a Report
  * Where supported by the backend services, all Browse and Search grids used in the report management interfaces are sortable in ways other than by relevant timestamp, and many are now filterable using standard egGrid filters

Significant portions of the UI are inherited from the Simple Reporter
implementation.  Additionally, many existing UI elements have been enhanced to
add supporting functionality, and any new functionality is available for use in
other interfaces.

=== Existing templates ===

Care has been taken to allow existing templates to function properly in the new interface implementation.  However, because the internal structure of the templates have changed, it is possible that some existing templates may need to be recreated.  




= SIP =
