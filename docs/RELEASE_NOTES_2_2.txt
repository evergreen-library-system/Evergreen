Upgrade notes
-------------

Z39.50 Server Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Z39.50 server target definitions have been removed from the sample
`opensrf.xml.example` file. To migrate existing settings from your
`opensrf.xml` configuration file to the database, peform the
following steps:

    1. First, set up your custom Z39.50 sources in the database. For
      each entry in `z3950/services`, map the following XML paths to the
      corresponding `config.z3950_source` table column as follows:
+
      ** `z3950/services/<entry>` = name
      ** `//<entry>/name` = label
      ** `//<entry>/host` = host
      ** `//<entry>/port` = port
      ** `//<entry>/db` = db
      ** `//<entry>/record_format` = record_format
      ** `//<entry>/transmission_format` = transmission_format
+
    2. Then, for each attribute defined in the `<attrs>` element for
       a given service, map the following XML paths to the corresponding
       `config.z3950_attr` table column as follows:
+
      ** `z3950/services/<entry>` = source
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>` = name
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>/code` = code
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>/format` = format
+
    3. After adding the new Z39.50 sources and corresponding attributes,
       you will need to log out of the staff client and log back into the
       staff client to retrieve the new entry values. If a given Z39.50
       server does not work for a given attribute, pay attention to the
       `truncation` column for the attribute.


New features
------------

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom Org Unit Trees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen enables you to create an organizational tree that describes the
systems, branches, or other units that comprise your organization. By default,
the org unit tree that appears to patrons in the OPAC is identical to the one
that appears to users of the staff client. Using this feature, you can condense
or re-order the organizational tree into a simpler structure for patrons using
the OPAC while maintaining the complex organizational tree that is available to
users of the staff client.

As a further enhancement, you can hide a parental org unit yet still make its
child org units visible in the OPAC. In previous versions of Evergreen, child
org units inherited the visibility setting of their parents.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Fine Accrual on Closed Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, fines accrue only on dates that the library is open. This feature
enables you to charge patrons fines on dates the library is closed. Fines
accrue during scheduled closings as well as during normal weekly closed dates.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Target Copies for Holds at Closed Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, when a patron places a hold on a title, the hold targeter will
search for copies to fill the hold only at circulating libraries that are open.
Copies at closed libraries are not targeted to fill holds. When turned on, this
feature enables Evergreen to target copies that have closed circulating
libraries to fill holds. Two new org unit settings control this feature.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

OPAC
~~~~

Template Toolkit OPAC (_TPAC_)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The basic catalog has been replaced by the Template Toolkit OPAC (_TPAC_).
Compared to the traditional catalog (_JSPAC_), TPAC uses far fewer network
calls for each page, resulting in faster loading pages. TPAC is built on the
http://template-toolkit.org[Template Toolkit] language to enable simple but
powerful customization, and supports integrated `gettext`-based translation
for strings--including placeholders and quantities--for better
internationalization support.

The next feature release of Evergreen will make TPAC the primary catalog
and deprecate the use of the JSPAC.

Auto Suggest in Catalog Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/_auto_suggest_in_catalog_search_2.html[auto
suggest feature] suggests the completion of search terms as the user enters his
query.  By default, the user will see ten suggestions although this
number is configurable at the database level.  Scroll through suggestions with
your mouse, or use the arrow keys to scroll through the suggestions. Select a
suggestion to view records that are linked to this suggestion. 

This feature is not turned on by default. You must turn it on in the Admin
module.

Copy Location Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature allows staff to create and name sets of copy locations to use as
a search filter in the catalog.  OPAC-visible groups will display within the
library selector in the template toolkit OPAC.  When a user selects a group
and performs a search, the set of results will be limited to records that have
copies in one of the copy locations within the group.  Groups can live at any
level of the library hierarchy and may include copy locations from any parent 
org unit or child org unit.

For advanced users, this change includes a new Query Parser filter called
location_groups().  

My Lists
^^^^^^^^
The My Lists feature replaces the bookbag feature that was available in
versions proior to 2.2. This feature enables you to create temporary and
permanent lists; create and edit notes for items in lists; place holds on items
in lists; and share lists via RSS feeds and CSV files.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/  

SMS Text Messaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The SMS Text Messaging feature enables users to receive hold notices via text
message. Users can opt-in to this hold notification as their default setting
for all holds, or they can receive specific hold notifications via text
message. Users can also send call numbers and copy locations via text message.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

New Patron Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users will now have the ability to designate the following preferences in the
Template Toolkit catalog (_TPAC_):

* A preferred search location. Unlike the default search library in JSPAC, this
  setting will also control which copies display first in search results and
  record detail screens.
* A preferred pickup location.
* The ability to keep a history of checked out items.
* The ability to keep a history of holds.

Credit Card Payment via Public Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patrons can now use credit cards to pay fines and bills in *My Account* of the
TPAC.

Record Detail Print and E-mail Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Implements Print and Email actions as links below the *Add to List* link
in the TPAC record detail page.

Identify Previously-Checked-Out Items in Search Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a user is logged into the TPAC and performs a search, this feature
indicates in the results set when any of the result items were ever checked
out by the logged-in user. Items will only be tagged when the related org
setting is enabled and the user has opted in to circ history tracking.

Patron Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron Statistical Category Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following enhancements have been added to patron statistical categories:

  * categories can be marked as 'required' (must be filled out when a patron is
    registered)
  * categories can be marked to allow or disallow user-created entries
  * an entry for a given category and org unit can be marked as the default
    entry. It will be automatically selected in the new patron registration
    screen.

User Settings Available from Patron Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Staff can now access and update user settings, like notification prefererences
and default pickup library, in the patron editor.

Mark Patron E-mail or Phone as Invalid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Staff can mark a patron's email address or phone number as invalid in the
patron editor. The system will clear the email (or phone) field from
`actor.usr`, and [both optionally, per OU setting]:

  . create a corresponding standing penalty against the user, for staff to
    notice next time they bring up said patron in the staff client;
  . create a patron note. Related penalties (but not notes) will be cleared
    whenever that patron's email address or phone number is updated again.

Address Alert in Patron Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Support for comparing user addresses to alert addresses.  When an address is
found, the address in question is styled (the header row turns red) and the
configured alert message is shown along the top-right, where other warnings
appear. 

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Telephony Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enhancements to notifications by telephony, including:

* A feature that allows an Evergreen system to roll over failed notifcations
  into new ones with a different notification method.
* Holiday awareness. System administrators can, via `cron`, schedule the
  `set_pbx_holidays` script on an Evergreen system to periodically update
  the PBX's table of holidays, based on a given org unit's closed date ranges.
* Smart retry. In certain situations, if you put too many callfiles into
  Asterisk's spool at once, Asterisk will try to make too many calls at
  once, and all such calls just fail. That is what the allocator is meant to
  prevent. Smart retry is about moving calls that have been tried once, and will
  be retried again later due to resulting in a busy signal or other problem, out
  of the spool to make room for other calls that could be made in the meantime.

Circulation Limit Groups & Limit Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The new *Circulation Limit Groups* interface found in the *Server
administration* menu can be thought of as _tags_ the system places on
circulations so that it can find them later. The *Limit Sets* interface found
in the *Local administration* menu defines rules for limiting the number of
active circulations a patron may have based on Circulation Modifiers and Limit
Groups. These new features support the following options:

* Setting circ limits for circulations that have no circ modifiers. This is
  useful for systems with circulation rules based on something other than
  circulation modifiers (for example, *MARC type*) or for grouping items
  that may have different circulation modifiers so that, for example, you
  can count every video, regardless of circulation modifiers.
* The ability to set limits for a single library's items, regardless of
  the checkout library.

New Checkin Modifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following modifiers have been added to the check-in interface:

* *Clear Shelf-Expired Holds*. When checking in something on the hold shelf,
  run a 'Clear Shelf Process' for the specific copy ID at that library to
  auto-clear any Shelf-Expired holds. 
* *Retarget Local Holds*. When checking in 'in process' items that are owned by
  the library, attempt to find a local hold to retarget. This is intended to
  help with proper targeting of newly-cataloged items.
* *Retarget All Statuses*. Similar to 'Retarget Local Holds', this modifier will
  attempt to find a local hold to retarget, regardless of the status of the
  item being checked in. This modifier must be used in conjunction with the
 'Retarget Local Holds' modifier.
* *Capture Local Holds as Transits*. With this checkin modifier, any local holds
  will be given an 'in transit' status instead of 'holds shelf'. The intent is
  to stop the system from sending holds notifications before the item is ready
  to be placed on the holds shelf. Possible use cases include Automated
  Materials Handling(AMH) checkins, in which items may be sitting in a bin for a
  while before landing on the holds shelf, and checkins done on closed days. 

Copy Location Alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This enhancement adds a new 'checkin_alert' column to copy locations. If true
(defaults to false), then a routing alert is generated at reshelving time for
the location. This is intended for special locations, such as 'Display', that
may require special handling, or that temporarily contain items that are not
normally in that location.

Age Hold Protection Based on a Copy's Active Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Adds a 'Sets copy active' column to the 'Copy Statuses' interface to identify
  statuses that indicate a copy is active and ready for checkout. The first
  time a copy is set to one of these statuses, the system adds an 'active date'
  for the copy, which can be used for reporting.
* Provides a new library setting for age hold protection to be based on the
  copy's active date instead of its create date.

Option to Place Holds on Age Protected Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow choice of placing hold despite age protection. This alters the backend to
watch when so much as one copy failed only due to age protection. In JSPAC, an
alternate confirm message is shown.  In TPAC, the failure message is changed
and override is always allowed for the hold in question.

Force and Cataloging Recall Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creates two new types of copy-level holds, *Force* and *Cataloging Recall*,
that cut in front of all other holds and ignore hold rules. For cataloging
recall holds, the copy's status changes to 'cataloging' when it reaches its
destination.

Archiving Statistical Categories and Circulation-Time Copy Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Circulation-time copy locations are now archived with circulations (aged or active).

Using the *Statistical Categories Editor*, staff can also designate statistical
categories (patron and copy) to archive with circulations.

Browse Holds Shelf Interface Displays Canceled Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Holds that are canceled after they are placed on the holds shelf will continue
to display in this interface and will also display in the 'shelf-expired holds'
view.

Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vandelay Integration into Acquisitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Acquisitions Load MARC Order Record interface enables you to add MARC
records to selection lists and purchase orders and upload the records into the
catalog. The Vandelay interface enables you to create specific match points
between incoming MARC records and exisiting catalog records. Combining these
two features enables you to track on order MARC records through the
Acquisitions interface and to utilize the record matching mechanisms available
in Vandelay when importing acquisitions records.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Receive Items from an Invoice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature enables users to receive items from an invoice. Staff can receive
individual copies, or they can receive items in batch.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Lineitem and Copy Actions Accessible from More Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users can now access lineitem actions (for example, receive, unreceive, update
barcodes, new invoice) from the acquisitions lineitem search results and
selection list interfaces. Also available on these interfaces is a link to copy
details where users can take receive actions (receive, unreceive, cancel) on
individual copies.

Improved Displays for Provider and Fund Administration Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This enhancement provides improved support for viewing the provider and fund
administation pages. It also allows staff to use filters to find providers and
funds.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

Authority Control Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The tags and subfields that display in authority records in Evergreen are
defined by control sets. The Library of Congress control set is the default
control set in all versions of Evergreen. However, in Evergreen release 2.2,
you can create customized control sets for authority records, and you can
define thesauri and authority fields for these control sets.

Patrons and staff can browse authorities in the JSPAC. The following fields are
browsable by default: author, series, subject, title, and topic. You can add
custom browse axes in addition to these default fields.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Batch Importing MARC Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The MARC Batch Import interface features improved matching of records and
managing of your import queue. In version 2.2, you can specify match points
between incoming and existing records to better detect matching records and
prevent record duplication. You can also create quality controls to ensure that
incoming matching records are superior in quality to existing catalog records.  

You also have new options for managing your queue.  You can apply filters to
your queue, and you can generate a list of import errors. You can also print
your queue, email your queue, or export your queue as a CSV file.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Hide Fields in Copy Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can customize the *Copy Editor* for staff by hiding fields in the *Copy
Editor* that are not relevant for workflows at particular org units. Descendant
org units inherit the settings of their parents.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/  

Prevent Bibliographic Records from Having Attached Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To enable libraries to designate specific sets of records as only for use as
electronic resources, it is possible to configure a bibliographic source such
that physical copies or MFHD records may not be attached to records from that
source. The `config.bib_source` table now includes a new Boolean column,
`can_have_copies`, that controls this behavior. If `can_have_copies` for a
given bibliographic source is `TRUE`, then the staff client will prevent a
cataloger from adding volumes or MFHD records to records belonging to that
source.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Overlay Existing Catalog Record via Z39.50 Import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can replace an existing catalog record with a record obtained through a
Z39.50 search. No new permissions or administrative settings are needed to use
this feature.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Restrict Z39.50 Sources by Permission Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use a permission to restrict users' access to Z39.50 servers. You can
apply a permission to the Z39.50 servers to restrict access to that server, and
then assign that permission to users or groups so that they can access the
restricted servers.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Switch Copy Location Name and Library Short Name in Copy Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, the copy editor shows the library shortname ('BR1' or 'CONS')
followed by the copy location name ('Stacks', 'Reference').  A new workstation
setting, under *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Copy Editor: Copy
Location Name First*, enables staff to change the display so that the copy
location name is displayed first, followed by the library shortname. This may
be particularly useful for libraries that have defined one set of copy
locations at the consortial level and want to enable quick keyboard navigation
to copy locations by typing just the first letters of the copy location.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

User Activity Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The User Activity Types feature enables you to specify the user activity that
you want to record in the database. You can use this feature for reporting
purposes. This function will also display a last activity date in a user's
account. Currently, this feature only tracks user authentication.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Authentication Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To support integration of Evergreen with organizational authentication systems,
and to reduce the proliferation of user names and passwords, Evergreen offers 
a new service called `open-ils.auth_proxy`. If you enable the service,
`open-ils.auth_proxy` supports different authentication mechanisms
that implement the `authenticate` method. You can define a chain of these
authentication mechanisms to be tried in order within the `<authenticators>`
element of the `opensrf.xml` configuration file, with the option of falling
back to the `native` mode that uses Evergreen's internal method of password
authentication.

This service only provides authentication; there is no support for automatic
provisioning of accounts. To authenticate against any authentication system,
the user account must first be defined within the Evergreen system, and
authentication will be based on the user name as it exists in Evergreen.

A sample authentication mechanism for LDAP is provided in
`Open-ILS::Application::AuthProxy::LDAP_AUTH`, and corresponding sample
attributes can be found in `opensrf.xml.example`.

Auditor Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This enhancement adds user and workstation IDs to the auditor tables. It also
adds/changes auditor functions to allow for setting, getting, and clearing
auditor information, as well as adding a couple of utility functions for
updating auditors after changes to their origin columns.

Reports
~~~~~~~

New Views for Reporting Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To support the creation of collection development reports, the following
reporting sources have been added:

  * 'Last Circulation or Creation Date' is a source that offers the copy ID,
    the last circulation date or creation date, and the last circulation date
  * 'Hold/Copy Ratio per Bib and Pickup Library' is a source that calculates
    the number of holds per copy per bibliographic record, with granularity
    by pickup library.


Staff Client Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customizable Toolbar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, two toolbars are available in the staff client: circulation and
cataloging. This feature enables you to customize toolbars in the staff client.
You can add buttons that will enable quick access to a variety of features.
You can create toolbars for specific org unit(s), workstation(s), or login(s).

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Double Clicking in the Staff Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can search for a patron's record, and double click on a result to access
that record. You can double click on an item in the *Holdings Maintenance*
screen to access copy information. The item is linked to the *Volume/Copy
Creator*, if you turned it on in the staff client's org unit settings. If you
did not turn on the *Volume/Copy Creator*, then the item links to the *Item
Attributes*.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Recent Staff Searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can view your recent searches as you perform them in the staff client. By
default, staff can view their recent searches, although the number is
configurable. This feature is only available through the staff client; it is
not available to patrons in the OPAC.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Return to Search Results from MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature enables you to return to your title search results directly from
any view of the MARC record, including the *OPAC View*, *MARC Record*, *MARC
Edit*, and *Holdings Maintenance* views. You can use this feature to page
through records in the *MARC Record View* or *Edit* interfaces. You do not have
to return to the *OPAC View* to access title results.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Sorting Columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature enables you to sort by multiple display columns so that you can
find easily the information that you need on a screen. You can sort display
columns on any screen that is built on a grid, such as the *Check In* screen or
the *On Shelf Pull List*.

You can also sort the columns on the following *Administration* screens:

  * Circulation Policies
  * Hold Policies
  * Circulation Limit Sets
  * Barcode Completion
  * Acquisitions User Request List
  * Vandelay Import Errors

You can sort items in an ascending or descending order, and you can prioritize
the order in which columns will sort.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Tab Button
^^^^^^^^^^
This feature enables you to add a new tab to the Evergreen staff client by
clicking the *+* sign adjacent to the tab that you currently have opened. As in
previous versions, you can also add new tabs by clicking *File -> New Tab*, or
use the hotkey, *Ctrl+T*.

Documentation for this feature is available in the Book of Evergreen at
http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.2/

Close All Tabs Shortcut
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use *CTRL+Click* on the close tab (*X*) button to close all tabs.

Independent Column Configurations and Receipt Templates for Different Hold List Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously, all hold list interfaces shared the same column picker settings and
receipt templates. This enhancement creates independent settings for the
following interfaces:

* Actions for this Record -> View Holds
* Patron Display -> Holds
* Circulation -> Browse Hold Shelf
* Circulation -> Pull List for Hold Requests

Line Number Columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
List displays in the staff client now have a non-sortable line number column
which displays the ordinal position of each row in the list. The first row in
such a list will always have a value of 1 in the ordinal column, no matter how
the list is sorted.  There is no special handling for paged interfaces; the
first row on any given page still gets an ordinal value of 1.

Auto-Login
^^^^^^^^^^
Supports auto-login in the staff client by adding three new command line
parameters:

* `-ILSuser`: user name to log in with
* `-ILSpassword`: password to use
* `-ILShost`: hostname to use
