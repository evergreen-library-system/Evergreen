== Evergreen 3.8.1 ==

This release contains bug fixes improving on Evergreen 3.8.0

=== Upgrade notes ===

The fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1939338[Launchpad bug 1939338] modifies the `fm_IDL.xml` file.  To ensure that everything is up-to-date, existing Evergreen sites should run `autogen.sh` after restarting OpenSRF services and before restarting Apache.

==== Backing Up Auditor `alert_message` Column ====

WARNING: The upgrade script will remove the alert_message field from the
auditor table, so if you care about preserving those you should run a query to
create a backup.

For example:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE auditor.backup_usr_alert_msg AS
   CREATE audit_id, audit_time, audit_action, audit_user,
          audit_ws, id as "usr_id", last_update_time,
          alert_message
   FROM auditor.actor_usr_history
   WHERE alert_message IS NOT NULL;
----

==== Reindexing for Search Suggestions ====

The upgrade includes a partial reindexing to update search suggestions. After
running the schema upgrade script, e.g., `version-upgrade/3.7.1-3.8.0-upgrade-db.sql`,
the reindexing can be done as follows.

First, in a `psql` session connected to your Evergreen database, run:

[source,sql]
----
\a
\t

\o title
select value from metabib.title_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);
\o author
select value from metabib.author_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);
\o subject
select value from metabib.subject_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);
\o series
select value from metabib.series_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);
\o identifier
select value from metabib.identifier_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);
\o keyword
select value from metabib.keyword_field_entry where source in (select id from biblio.record_entry where not deleted);

\o
\a
\t
\q
----

Then, from the command line:

[source,sh]
----
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl title > title.sql
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl author > author.sql
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl subject > subject.sql
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl series > series.sql
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl identifier > identifier.sql
$ ~/EG-src-path/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/symspell-sideload.pl keyword > keyword.sql
----

Then finally, back in `psql`:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE search.symspell_dictionary SET UNLOGGED;
TRUNCATE search.symspell_dictionary;

\i identifier.sql
\i author.sql
\i title.sql
\i subject.sql
\i series.sql
\i keyword.sql

CLUSTER search.symspell_dictionary USING symspell_dictionary_pkey;
REINDEX TABLE search.symspell_dictionary;
ALTER TABLE search.symspell_dictionary SET LOGGED;
VACUUM ANALYZE search.symspell_dictionary;

DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_title;
DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_author;
DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_subject;
DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_series;
DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_identifier;
DROP TABLE search.symspell_dictionary_partial_keyword;
----

==== Updating Reports on Patron Notes ====

The underlying data structure for patron notes has changed with all notes
living in the `actor.usr_message` table, so report writers will need to change
the following paths in existing reports:

 * `actor.usr_note` -> all columns
 * `actor.usr` -> `alert_message`
 * `actor.usr_standing_penalty` -> note

And for `actor.usr_message`, there is now both a `pub` column and a `deleted` column.

==== Holdings Editor Preferences ====

Given the number of changes between the AngJS holdings editor and the
new Angular interfaces, preferences stored for the AngJS interface will
not be honored by the new interface.  New preferences will have to be
applied by staff as needed.

=== New Features ===

==== Acquisitions ====

===== Angular Rewrite of Acquisitions Administration Interfaces =====

Several administrative interfaces for acquisitions have been rewritten
to use the Angular framework:

  * Claiming
  * Currencies and Exchange Rates
  * Distribution Formulas
  * EDI Attribute Sets
  * Fund Administration

====== Claiming ======

The interface for managing claim policies is now a single multi-tabbed
page that combines the previous interfaces for:

  * Claim Policies
  * Claim Policy Actions
  * Claim Types
  * Claim Event Types

The new interface can be found in Administration > Acquisitions
Administration > Claiming.

====== Currencies and Exchange Rates ======

The previous two interfaces for managing currencies and exchange
rates have been consolidated into one. The new interface allows
users to create, modify, and delete currency types. In addition,
the list of currencies now has 'Manage Exchange Rates' buttons
to allow specifying the exchange rate from the selected currency
to another one.

If an exchange is set in one direction, e.g., from USD to EUR,
opening the 'Manage Exchange Rates' for EUR will show the inverse
of the exchange rate for USD as a read-only field.

The new interface can be found in Administration > Acquisitions
Administration > Currencies and Exchange Rates.

====== Distribution Formulas ======

The Angular interface for managing distribution formulas displays
a grid of existing formulas and allows authorized users to create,
modify, and delete formulas. The dialog for editing a formula
allows the user to define one or more entries containing
owning library, number of items, and optionally shelving location, fund,
circulation modifier, and collection code.

The new interface can be found in Administration > Acquisitions
Administration > Distribution Formulas.

====== EDI Attribute Sets ======

The Angular EDI attribute sets interface is similar to the previous
one. However, it includes enhancements to display the number of
providers using an attribute set as well as a 'View Providers' button
to navigate to those providers.

The new interface can be found in Administration > Acquisitions
Administration > EDI Attribute Sets.

====== Fund Administration ======

The new fund administration interface unifies configuration of funding
sources, purchasing funds, and fund tags. The interface has three tabs:

  * Funds
  * Funding Sources
  * Fund Tags

The Funds tab displays a filterable list of funds that allows the
user to create, modify, and remove funds. The fund name is hyperlinked;
clicking that hyperlink opens a dialog that has the following tabs:

  * Summary: this contains summary information about the fund,
    including various balances.
  * Allocations: this lists allocations to and from the fund.
  * Transfers: this lists fund transfers to and from the fund.
  * Debits: this lists debits against the fund. As an enhancement
    from the previous version of the funds interface, the grid
    of debits now has links to the line item, purchase order,
    and/or invoice associated with the debit.
  * Tags: this lists the tags associated with the funds and allows
    the user to add or remove tag associations.

The fund management dialog also allows the user to create allocations
into the fund and transfer money away from the fund.

The funds tab also has a 'Fiscal Propagation and Rollover' button.
The library from the selector on the funds tab is used to set the
context org unit for the propagation and rollover. Upon clicking the
button, a dialog box appears that allows the user to select the fiscal
year to propagate or rollover, checkboxes to specify whether to also
perform a fiscal year close-out and whether to limit a close-out to
encumbrances, and a checkbox to specify whether or not to do a dry run.
Upon completion of the propagation, the dialog will display summary
results.


The Funding Sources tab displays a filterable list of funding
sources and allows the user to create funding sources, apply and view
credits, allocate money to funds, and view allocations.

The Fund Tags tab presents a grid that allows users view view,
create, modify, and delete fund tags. Assigning a tag to a fund is
done using the fund management dialog.

The new interface can be found in Administration > Acquisitions
Administration > Fund Administration.

====== Other Changes ======

The following miscellaneous changes are included in this work:

* Funds are now displayed in Angular selectors with the pattern
  "CODE (YEAR) (OWNING_LIBRARY)"
* The automatically generated fund allocation note associated with
  fund transfers now reads "Transfer to/form fund CODE (YEAR) (OWNER)".
  Previously, the fund was identified only by its numeric fund ID.
* A new style was added for display of negative money amounts. By
  default, these amounts display with red text.
* The fund propagation and rollover report now includes the total
  amount of encumbrances that were rolled over.
* Various dynamic Angular comboboxes will now display up to 100
  entries upon a click without requiring that the user submit a
  search term.
* Various Angular record editing forms will now complain if
  the user tries to save a field value that contains only whitespace.
* Currency amounts in Angular are no longer displayed with a currency
  symbol. Prior to this change, monetary amounts were displayed with
  a dollar sign regardless of the intended currency.
* Various changes were made in the IDL to adjust field labels and
  to mark certain fields as required.

===== Fund Debit Auditor Table =====

A new auditor table now exists for the `acq.fund_debit` table. This
allows detailed reporting on changes to encumbrances and expenditures
over time.


===== Miscellaneous =====

* Funding sources now have an active flag. If a funding source is marked
  as inactive, adding credits to it or allocating from it is disabled, and
  it will not show up in the list of possible funding sources when allocating
  to a fund.

==== Administration ====

===== Case Insensitive Browse Entries =====

It is now possible for a system administrator to select whether
a particular browse entry field's case should be considered when
determining uniqueness.  A new "Browse Folding is Case-Insensitive"
column has been added to the Administration -> Server Administration
-> MARC Search/Facet Fields interface.  Note that a bib record reingest
will be required for changes to take effect.

===== Miscellaneous =====

* The 'Search Filter Groups' administration interface is now ported
  to Angular.

==== Cataloging ====

===== Holdings Maintenance & Item Attributes Editor Angular Port =====

Key differences from the AngularJS Holdings and Item Attr. editor 
interfaces include the following:

* Tabbed Holdings vs. Item Attr. interfaces.
** With option to display as a unified interface without tabs.
* Item Attr. fields retain position when showing/hiding
* Improve keyboard navigation of Item Attr. editor.
* Templates are once again managed directly in the Item Attr. editor.
* Item Attr. displays values as counts summaries with option to edit by
  clicking on a field (or tabbing + Enter) a la XUL.
* Item Attr batch values support changing only items with selected values.
* Batch value display limit vertical expansion of long lists with option for 
  manual expansion.
* All fields are visible by default; hidden by modifying preferences. 
* Owning Library is managed in the Item Attr editor a la XUL.
* New feature called "Change Circ Lib When Owning Lib Changes"
* Generate Barcodes and Use Checkdigit are visible in the main holdings
  form with option to hide.
* Print Labels checkbox moved from Preferences to the save actions toolbar.
* Option to hide various Holdings interface columns for extra horizontal space.
* Option to temporarily expand columns in the Holdings interface for reviewing
  wide columns of text.

===== Fix for Authority Records with Long Subfields =====

Importing or updating authority records with long subfields, i.e. in
the vicinity of 5,000 characters or more in length, can cause database
errors that will prevent the update or import from happening.  The
error occurs because non-full text indexes in PostgreSQL have a
limited length, and long fields sometimes lead to index entries that
exceed this maximum value.

In order to rectify this issue, two database indexes on the
`authority.full_rec` table's `value` column have been redefined to
match their counterparts in the `metabib.real_full_rec` table.  After
this update, only the first 1024 characters of an authority field or
subfield will be considered by these indexes.

NOTE: These indexes are not used for authority record search, though
they are used for sorting and paging.

===== Bib Record -1 Can No Longer Be Edited =====

Now when retrieving the bibliographic record with the id of -1 the
delete button will be missing and the save button is disabled.

In addition, new database rules now protect bib record ID -1,
call number ID -1 and copy location ID 1 from editing.

===== MARC Batch Import/Export Separate Edit Date/Editor Toggle =====

Adds a new field "Update Bib Edit Date" to Vandelay merge profiles which
allows users to update the edit date and editor information on a
merged/overlaid bib record without also having to modify the bib source.

For backwards compatibility, any existing merge profiles that have 
"Update Bib Source" applied will also get "Update Bib Edit Date" applied.

===== Browse Heading Navigation =====

In the Angular staff catalog, when viewing the list of bib records linked
to a heading, it's now possible to navigate to the previous or next heading
directly on the bib list page without having to return to the original
browse search.

===== Bibliographic Record Notes =====

Bibliographic record notes (i.e., administrative notes stored in the
`biblio.record_note` table, not 5XX fields in the MARC record) can now
be edited from the Record Notes tab.  Three new permissions manage this
and should be added to cataloging accounts and permission groups as
appropriate:  `CREATE_RECORD_NOTE`, `UPDATE_RECORD_NOTE`, and
`DELETE_RECORD_NOTE`. There is an optional public display flag that is
not yet supported in the public catalog but included to support future functionality.

==== Circulation ====

===== Granular control over how to use price and acquisition cost to determine item value  =====

This feature adds two new library settings:

 * Use Item Price or Cost as Primary Item Value
 * Use Item Price or Cost as Backup Item Value

Which intersect the behavior of these existing settings:

 * Charge lost on zero
 * Default Item Price
 * Minimum Item Price
 * Maximum Item Price

Each of these settings affect how item price is used in
various contexts and is not limited to "lost" items, but
can affect notices, fine rules, and billings for long
overdue and damaged items (as well as lost items).

By default, the price field on items is the only field
considered by these various uses, but if we set, for
example, "Use Item Price or Cost as Primary Item Value" to
"cost", then we'll use the cost field instead of the price
field.

Alternately, if we set the "Backup Item Value" to "cost"
and either leave the "Primary Item Value" setting unset or
set to "price", then we'll consider the price field first,
and if it is either unset/null or equal to 0 (and
"Charge lost on zero" is true), then it'll fall-through to
the cost field.  We can also flip the behavior with these
settings and consider cost first and then price second.

The primary intended use case for this feature is:

 - If there's an acquisition cost, charge this as the lost value.
 - If there's not an acquisition cost, but there's a price, charge the price.
 - If neither, charge the default value.

===== Library selector on the holds pull list =====

The holds pull list screen now includes a library/org unit selector.
This allows staff to view the pull list of any library where they have
VIEW_HOLDS permissions, rather than having to log in to a workstation
at that library.

===== Angular Holds Pull List =====

The holds pull list now uses Angular and has an address of `/eg2/en-US/staff/circ/holds/pull-list`.

===== New Item Triggered Events Log =====

A reimplementation of the Item Triggered Events Log interface, building
on the Patron Triggered Events Log Angular reimplementation.

===== Template Support for Information and My Account URLs =====

A new setting has been added named `lib.my_account_url` to provide a
path usable in templates to a patron's account login. Both this and
the existing `lib.info_url` settings are now available in the
server-side processed templates, action triggers and traditional print
receipts.

Web side processed templates can be found in 
Administration -> Server Administration -> Print Templates.

You can add settings using the following syntax:

[source,html]
----
<div>[% helpers.get_org_setting(staff_org.id, 'lib.info_url'); %]</div>
<div>[% helpers.get_org_setting(staff_org.id, 'lib.my_account_url'); %]</div>
----

Print Receipts found in Administration -> Workstation -> Print Templates
can be added with these includes:

[source,conf]
----
{{includes.info_url}}
{{includes.my_account_url}}

Action triggers can use both values with the `helpers.get_org_setting`
include.  Example:

[source,conf]
----
[% helpers.get_org_setting(circ_lib.id, 'lib.my_account_url') %]

===== Override Dialogs  =====

This reworks the override action dialogs in the patron display for Check Out
and Items Out, and in the Circulation -> Renew Items interface.  It exposes the
auto-override behavior as checkboxes giving staff more fine-grained control
over which events are auto-forced or skipped upon subsequent encounters.  It
also changes the Cancel action for batch renewals to abort the remaining
renewals in the batch, and makes it so that new authorization credentials
provided during such a batch will be treated as an operator change for the
entire batch.  We also fix an existing bug where events marked as already
encountered for auto-override could leak into other patron contexts via Patron
Search.

===== New Patron Triggered Events Log =====

A reimplementation of the Patron Triggered Events Log interface along with
supporting infrastructure for speedier results with large datasets.

===== Photo URL  =====

Editing of the patron's photo URL can now be done in the staff client's patron
registration and edit screen. A new permission UPDATE_USER_PHOTO_URL controls
the ability to actually edit the field.

===== `open-ils.circ.renew.auto` Removed =====

The deprecated `open-ils.circ.renew.auto` API was removed.  You will
want to use `open-ils.circ.renew` with the `auto_renewal` option set
to 1.  This mainly affects those who have written custom code using
the open-ils.circ backend.

===== Void Deposit Billing at Checkin =====

There is a new setting called "Void item deposit fee on checkin"
that, when enabled, will cause items that have deposit billings
to be automatically voided.

===== Miscellaneous =====

* The patron record editor now has a button to send a password
  reset email to the patron's email address.
* Add a new pair of library settings to support pickup library-based
  hold stalling. 'Pickup Library Soft stalling interval', when set for,
  the pickup library, specifies that for holds with a request time age
  smaller than the specified interval only items scanned at the pickup
  library can be opportunistically captured. Example "5 days". This setting
  takes precedence over "Soft stalling interval" (circ.hold_stalling.soft)
  when the interval is in force. 'Pickup Library Hard stalling interval',
  when set for the pickup library, specifies that no items with a
  calculated proximity greater than 0 from the pickup library can be
  directly targeted for this time period if there are local available
  copies.
* Add a new library setting, 'Workstation OU is the default for staff-placed holds',
  to indicate that the workstation OU should be set as the default pickup
  location for hold requests that are placed via the staff interface. The
  process for setting the default pickup location is now:
  . Workstation if the 'Workstation OU is the default for staff-placed holds' setting
    is turned on
  . The user's preferred pickup location, if set
  . if the user's preferred pickup location is not set, the
    Workstation if the 'Workstation OU fallback for staff-placed holds'
    setting is turned on
  . Otherwise, it defaults to the user's home library.

===== Consolidate Patron Notes, Alerts, and Messages =====

Patron notes, messages, alert messages, and standing penalties have been folded
into one Notes interface.  Notes designated as public will show in the My
Account -> Message Center in the public catalog for patrons.

The underlying data structure has also changed with all notes living in the
`actor.usr_message` table, so report writers will need to change the following
paths in existing reports:

 * `actor.usr_note` -> all columns
 * `actor.usr` -> `alert_message`
 * `actor.usr_standing_penalty` -> note

And for `actor.usr_message`, there is now both a `pub` column and a `deleted` column.

Depending on privacy policies, system administrators may wish to set up a
recurring process to truly delete older entries in `actor.usr_message` that have
been flagged as deleted.

WARNING: The upgrade script will remove the alert_message field from the
auditor table, so if you care about preserving those you should run a query to
create a backup.

For example:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE auditor.backup_usr_alert_msg AS
   CREATE audit_id, audit_time, audit_action, audit_user,
          audit_ws, id as "usr_id", last_update_time,
          alert_message
   FROM auditor.actor_usr_history
   WHERE alert_message IS NOT NULL;
----

===== Fix for Staff Splash Page Multi-Word Search =====

The addition of the Angular Staff Catalog surfaced a double-encoding issue
with redirects in certain Apache versions. This caused searches for multiple
words to have %20 in place of spaces, almost certainly resulting in 0 results.

In order to apply this fix, change the Angular redirects in eg_vhost.conf from

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [R=307,L]

to

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [NE,R=307,L]

===== Miscellaneous =====

* In the Angular staff catalog, rename 'Catalog Preferences' to
  'Search Preferences' and add a return button.
* Angular grids now have a have a 'Manage Actions Menu' configuration
  action to allow users to control which actions are displayed
  on the context menu for the grid.
* The item table and holdings view in the Angular staff catalog record
  details page now include 'Total Circ Count' and 'Last Circ Date' columns.
* There is a new library setting, 'Staff Catalog Search Filters', that can be
  used to customize the list of search filters that are available on the
  Angular staff catalog advanced search form. This setting takes an array
  of desired filters, e.g., `["item_lang","audience","lit_form"]`. The complete
  list of available filters is item_type, item_form, item_lang, audience,
  vr_format, bib_level, and lit_form. If the library setting is not set,
  all of the filters are displayed.

==== Public Catalog ====

===== Credit card payments using Stripe now implemented with PaymentIntents instead of Charges =====

This changes the Stripe code in the public catalog to use their PaymentIntents and confirmCreditCard API,
which is recommended over their Charges API.  Credit card charges are no longer finalized
(captured/confirmed) on Evergreen's backend, though the backend does check whether a payment was
made successfully before recording it.

===== Miscellaneous =====

* The Bootstrap public catalog now displays cover images on the My Account
  items checked out, check out history, holds, and holds history pages.
* Carousels on the public catalog home page now take up 80% of the page width
  by default rather than just 40%.

==== Reports ====

===== Reporter Item Statistics View =====

A new reports source, Item Statistics View is available.
Certain third-party products such as collection development
management providers require copy statistics that are not
readily available in a single report.  This view adds those,
which will also benefit library staff reports generally.

To add the view, a system administrator will need to (re-)run
the example.reporter-extension.sql script, which will create 
the new view in the database.

===== Hold/Copy Ratio Report Source Changes =====

This standardizes how the existing Hold/Copy Ratio reports sources count holdable copies; notably, metarecord copies are no longer counted in these report sources and all sources now use action.hold_copy_map. 

Any reports using these sources will need to be rewritten.

A new source that breaks out counts by patron home library was also added, named Hold/Copy Ratio per Bib and Home Library.


===== Add Dewey Call Number Blocks and Ranges to Reports =====

A new view is added to the reporter with links from Call Number that
will allow users to display or filter on the Dewey 10's or 100's block
or range that a call number falls within. They can be accessed by
following the "Dewey Classification" link from Call Number.

===== More Granular Age Divisions for Reports =====

Reports now include an option for more detailed age divisions for users
based on the entered date of birth.  Divisions include:

 * Child 0-5 Years Old
 * Child 6-12 Years Old
 * Teen 13-17 Years Old
 * Adult 18-25 Years Old
 * Adult 26-49 Years Old
 * Adult 50-59 Years Old
 * Adult 60-69 Years Old
 * Adult 70+

This new column is accessible from ILS User -> Demographic Info and the new
field is named "Detailed Age Division".
