== Documentation URL ==

You can add a link to local documentation that can help staff create a report template.  To add documentation to a report template, click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Reports*, and create a new report template.  A new field, *Documentation URL*, appears in the *Template Configuration* panel.  Enter a URL that points to relevant documentation.

== Field Hints ==

Descriptive information about fields or filters in a report template can be added to the *Field Hints* portion of the *Template Configuration* panel.  For example, a circulation report template might include the field, *Circ ID*.  You can add content to the *Field hints* to further define this field for staff and provide a reminder about the type of information that they should select for this field.


To view a field hint, click the *Column Picker*, and select *Field Hint*.  The column will be added to the display.
