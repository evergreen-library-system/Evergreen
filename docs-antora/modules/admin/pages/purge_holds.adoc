== Purging holds ==

Similar to purging circulations one may wish to purge old (filled or canceled) hold information. This feature adds a database function and
settings for doing so.

Purged holds are moved to the _action.aged_hold_request_ table with patron identifying information scrubbed, much like circulations are moved
to _action.aged_circulation_.

The settings allow for a default retention age as well as distinct retention ages for holds filled, holds canceled, and holds canceled by
specific cancel causes. The most specific one wins unless a patron is retaining their hold history. In the latter case the patron's holds
are retained either way.

Note that the function still needs to be called, which could be set up as a cron job or done more manually, say after statistics collection.
You can use the _purge_holds.srfsh_ script to purge holds from cron.
