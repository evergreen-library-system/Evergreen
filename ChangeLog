    LP2068934 Circulating Library vs Checkout Library Terminology
    
    This attempts to make the user interface (particularly, the Reporter)
    more consistent and clear by changing "Circulating Library" to
    "Checkout / Renewal Library" where it is useful to differentiate the
    checkout library from an item's assigned circulating library. Updates
    are included for:
    
    - All Circulation Combined Types
    - Combined Aged and Active Circulations (Slim Version)
    - Combined Aged and Active Circulations
    - Aged (patronless) Circulation
    - Overdue Circulation
    - Open Circulation Billing by Circulating Library and Owning Library
    - Open Circulation Balance by Circulating Library and Owning Library
    
    Release-note: Updates 'Circulating Library' to 'Checkout / Renewal Library' where relevant

    LP#2044854: removing caching of Z39.50 target defs by open-ils.search
    
    This patch removes per-child-process caching of Z39.50 target definitions
    to address several issues caused by the caching:
    
    - If any targets have a use permission attached, whether
      such a target is available to a user can be inconsistent
      based on who last fetched (and cached) service definitions
      from a particular open-ils.search backend.
    - Z39.50 searches may sporadically fail to use
      targets that were recently added.
    
    This patch also:
    
    * removes a $default_service package variable that is not used
    * adds a TODO note regarding getting rid of the final legacy
      of Z39.50 target definitions in opensrf.xml.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Verify that Z39.50 searches work normally, including
        searching multiple targets at once, search the native
        Evegreen catalog, doing raw searches, and searching from
        both catalog and acquistions.
    [3] Verify that there's no sporadic search failures when
        using targets that have a use permission associated with them.

    LP2034956: Check authtoken validity more frequently
    
    Just hard-code the validity check to 3 minutes. Since the timer will start
    at an essentially random time for each tab there shouldn't be much threat of
    overwhelming the auth service with this relatively fast call.
    
    This should help keep staff authtokens "fresher" in memcached until lp 1753565
    is addressed.
    
    Release-note: Check the staff client authentication session every three minutes, reducing chances of hidden eviction of the session

    LP#2076350: Reporter trees start collpased
    
    Long folder trees in the reports interfaces are hard to use when they
    start expanded, even just at the top level.  This commit initializes
    them fully collapsed to start with, and where selection is required,
    such as in the Report Definition editor when a destination folder is
    not otherwise selected, it expands them.
    
    It also uses a clone of the report and output folder trees so that the
    main-interface trees are not modified by the template and definition
    editors.

    LP#2069062: Speed up hold ratio reports
    
    The Hold Ratio reporting source finds the common ancestor of the hold
    pickup library and each relevant copy's circ library using two calls to
    the ancestor.org_unit_ancestor_at_depth() function.  This is the most
    direct way to determine if two org units share a specific common
    ancestor, but it is also very expensive.
    
    This commit restructures the query by precalculating the set of
    descendants for each org unit, which allows for a faster test of whether
    the pickup and circ libs are both in the same descendant list.  This is
    definitionally the same test as having a particular common ancestor, but
    can be performed MUCH faster.

    LP#2077354: eg-tree range selection and filtering
    
    Range Selection
    ===============
    
    This commit adds the ability to shift-click a second eg-tree node state
    flag checkbox and have all the tree nodes between the newly shift-clicked
    node checkbox and the previously clicked checkbox be selected.  This
    includes intervening descendant nodes whether they are collapsed or
    expanded, and any descendants of the shift-clicked node.
    
    If a node is shift-clicked without a different node being checked
    beforehand, the shift-clicked node /and all of it's descendants, whether
    collapsed or visible/ are selected.  This allows one to select a branch
    of the tree (including selecting the entire tree, if the root node is
    shift-clicked) in one go.
    
    Shift-clicking applies the NEW checked-or-not value from the
    shift-clicked node to the selection range, it does /not/ attempt to
    invert each individual node's state flag (checkbox) value or otherwise
    be overly fancy.
    
    Range selection can be done in either direction, up or down the tree.
    
    Node Filtering
    ==============
    
    An optional flag is added to the eg-tree component to enable filtering
    based on the node labels.  This is implemented in two basic parts:
    
      * A new restictedNodes tree property that shows only those tree paths
        (including ancestors of restrictedNodes members) that are required
        to show display the members of the restricedNodes set.
      * A debounced text input that searches the tree for nodes with labels
        that contain the user-supplied string.  Strings are normalized using
        the String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase() function, and compared
        using the String.prototype.search() function.
    
    The restrictedNodes property is used directly by the reporter to show
    only the selected nodes, and their ancestors, when the eg-tree component
    is disabled in the Report Definition Editor when the template has
    supplied values to the eg-tree.
    
    Finally, specifically in the case of eg-tree use in the Reporter, the
    tree container is now made a vertically scrollable height-limited box.

    LP#1878984: Fix Preserve specification
    
    When processing a Preserve specification, vandelay.replace_field fails
    to account for the situation where the target record does not have any
    instances of the field to be preserved.  This commit copies fields from
    the source to the target when there are no like target fields and the
    source fields are not restricted by a match requirement.
    
    It additionally adds multi-subfield match requirement capabilities to
    the add_field and replace_field functions, as implemented in the branch
    submitted for LP#1901597 that does the same for strip_field.
    
    Release-note: Fix bug in Merge/Overlay Profile preserve specifications.

    LP1989740 Available Copy/Hold Ratio use Age Protection
    
    Reworked SQL function action.copy_related_hold_stats, which determines
    the Total Copy/Hold ratio and Available Copy/Hold ratio.
    
    action.copy_related_hold_stats now calls action.hold_request_permit_test
    on every hold on the same title as the copy it's given.
    This way it will not only check if the book is lost or age protected,
    but anything that might later be added that makes a book unavailable for
    holds.
    
    Added a new attribute to the record action.copy_related_hold_stats
    returns, 'competing_holds'. This value is now what the available ratio
    uses, and represents the number of holds the copy in question could
    fulfill. (as determined by the hold permit test)
    
    Release-note: Consider age protection when determining if a patron can renew an item that others are waiting for.

    LP#2077419: Correct reporting source visibility
    
    Several ACQ-related IDL views were added for reporting purposes in 3.12.
    They were incorrectly marked virtual instead of readonly, but the old
    reporting UI made them available anyway because it was too lax when
    checking which sources to show or hide.  This commit makes them
    available again in the new full reporter UI.
    
    I've included a source comment in the XSD for the oils_persist XML
    namespace definition that clarifies the purpose of the virtual
    attribute.
    
    To test:
     * See that you cannot access the "Invoice Totals" source
     * Install the updated IDL, autogen and restart services
     * See that you can now access the source

    LP#1906462: Incorporate feedback from review
    
    * Allow clearing combobox values (Many thanks to Dan Briem for the guidance on how
      to do this!!)
    * If you choose to receive without barcoding, the Auto-barcode option grays out.
    * If you choose to auto-barcode, the barcode fields gray out.
    * Match Apply to All button styling to the AngularJS version
    * Add padding within the serials receive item table
    * Set a default call number based on the most recent call number on the bib from the
      distribution org unit.
    * Remove duplicate values from call number comboboxes
    * Allow a user to hide call number prefixes and suffixes with a checkbox.  The value
      is stored in the user's browser localStorage, so they don't have to click it off
      each time if they never use it.
    
    Also, correct some copy-pasta that led to a field getting the wrong accessible name

    This patch allows null/undef call number prefixes and suffixes to be passed to the
    main serials receiving method; if null is passed, the affix will instead be
    assumed to be the empty string.

commit 5a1ce90eadcef7cb9657d8bba33ce9c1397c76f1
Author: Jane Sandberg <sandbergja@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 4 20:14:38 2023 -0800

    lp1906462: Angular quick receive
    
    To test:
    1. Set up some subscriptions and predict some issues.
      a. Open your favorite bib record in the staff catalog.
      b. Go to Serials > Manage Subscriptions.
      c. Add a new subscription with a start date of today.  If you want to test the
         barcode receive functionality, select a Receiving Template you have previously
         created in Admin > Serials Admin > Serial Item Templates.
      d. If you want to test the routing lists, use the actions menu to select
         "Add Additional Routing" and add some users and/or departments.
      e. Go to the Manage Predictions tab
      f. Press Add New
      g. Press Create from Template
      h. Select Daily
      i. Press Create
      j. Press Predict New Issues
      k. Select the number of issues you want to Predict
    2. Go back to the bib record
    3. Go to Serials > Quick Receive
    4. Select the appropriate org unit and subscription
    5. Press Continue
    6. Enter any necessary metadata.  Uncheck any items you don't want to receive.
    7. Press Receive or Receive and Print Routing List.
    8. Confirm that Serials > Manage Subscriptions > Manage Issues tab shows the
    issues as received now.
    
    Also, fix the following issues:
    * Fix form validation: if "Barcode items" checkbox is not selected,
      don't require barcode.
    * Make patron address data available to the serials routing list template
    * Only show - before note in serials routing list if there is a note to show
    * Add a button for applying the batch controls, rather than
      auto-applying when values change
    * item-location-select component: it previously did not reliably mark
      itself as "touched".
    * combobox component: if the entrylist hadn't yet been loaded, using
      patchValue and setValue previously didn't display the new value to
      the user.
    * A small capitalization issue.
    * fix failing timezone-dependent test
    * Don't auto-barcode items when a receive template is active but barcode mode is off
    * display distribution and subscription notes
    * Also, display a cute icon if the note is an alert
    * Provide a dropdown of existing call number labels on the bib record in question
    * better wording for the batch actions
    * don't print routing lists that weren't selected for print
    
    Thanks to Galen for catching that the 'sets subscriptionList property' test failed
    when run with a timezone that is UTC-4 or greater, and for suggesting the fix.
    
    Rather than hardcoding timezone offsets in our test data, let's see what the
    current timezone offset is, and use that in our test data.
    
    To run the tests in various timezones on UNIX-style operating systems, you can use
    the TZ environment variable, e.g.:
    
    TZ=Europe/Helsinki npm run test
    TZ=Pacific/Honolulu npm run test

    LP#1910444 Survey permissions prevent questions from being added
    
    The survey permissions check was looking for the owning org unit in the
    wrong way, which was causing it to always fail to find the
    permissions, even if they existed. Changed the check to look at if the
    field is fleshed and get it the right way if so.
    Also made the update fail text not be a lie.
    
    Allowed users to edit surveys if they have the UPDATE_SURVEY permission.
    Did this in the fieldmapper too so that the 'Edit Survey' tab can save.
    
    Release-note: Allows staff to edit survey questions and answers with UPDATE_SURVEY perm
    
    Steps to test:
    [1] Sign into an account other than globaladmin that has the
    ADMIN_SURVEY permission
    [2] Proceed to Administration -> Local Admin -> Surveys
    [3] Create a survey or select an existing survey
    [4] Go to Questions and Answers
    [5] Make, change, and delete some questions and answers.
    [6] Sign into an account with ONLY UPDATE_SURVEY permission and WITHOUT
    ADMIN_SURVEY (or change
    permissions of an account to make one)
    [7] Repeat steps 2-5
    [8] Sign into an account with neither UPDATE_SURVEY nor ADMIN_SURVEY
    [9] Repeat steps 2-5

    Due to internal structural changes, support for editing and viewing
    reports based on templates prior to version 6 (the new angular version)
    was not always possible.  This commit improves support for older
    template versions by upgrading the template at run time when necessary,
    and by providing more backward-compatable operator detection.
    
    Release-note: Improve support for report templates created using previous versions of the reporter.

    It also brings back the (rarely used) "round" transform.
    
    Release-note: Reporter: Normalize count and date transforms, and add round transform

    LP1807998: Fix Canadian Dollars currency code
    
    This commit replaces the erroneous 'CAN' code with 'CAD' in the
    acq.currency_type table.
    
    It also modifies the foreign keys that reference the
    acq.funding_source.currency_type.code column to cascade on update.
    
    A regression test is provided to check that the Canadian Dollar's
    currency code is 'CAD' and not 'CAN', and that foreign key
    relationships exist on the exchange_rate and funding_source
    acquisitions tables.
    
    The base of this code was "stolen" from Rogan Hamby and then squashed
    into a single commit.
    
    Release-note: Fixes the Canadian Dollars currency symbol to CAD for acquisitions.

    LP:2077998: Shelving location group dropped in library selection box
    
    A fix in LP2019157 scrubbed a little too much from the loc_value in
    misc_util.tt2. Shelving location groups are represented as, for example,
    1:15 which is the owning location followed by the location group.  This
    commit alters the regular expression so it removes any non-digit characters
    from loc_value but also preserves colon characters.
    
    Release-note: Prevent the shelving location group from being dropped in
    the library selection box in the OPAC.
