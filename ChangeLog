    LP#2087562: Fix node-parent tracking in dynamic trees
    
    Root issue and resolution:
    
    Node-parent tracking was added to eg-tree in order to facilitate fast
    traversal for filtering back in commit 1bfe22, but dynamic trees (those
    constructed using the childernCB method) were not having their parent
    links updated at the appropriate time.  Those links replace the older
    "climb through the entire structure looking for my parent" mechanism, so
    we need to make sure we add the parent link when dynamic children are
    added.
    
    Additionally, some users of eg-tree modify the internal structure of
    trees manually.  In these cases the parent links and other state-related
    information is not automatically maintained.
    
    This commit fixes those by forcing a maintenance cycle after calling the
    childrenCB method, and whenever a non-root, un-parented node is used in
    a tree-level method.
    
    Practical impact:
    
    In the reporter, we use childrenCB to build the report source tree,
    because it's essentially unbounded. Then, we use the path from the core
    source (tree root) to the selected leaf source to construct the join
    tree for that specific leaf.  Because the node-parent links were not
    always updated when we need them to be, the path was sometimes empty and
    the join tree was truncated.  The effect was the core and leaf sources
    (tables) were joined directly, dropping all intermediate tables.  The
    link updating fixes the path retrieval, which in turn fixes the join
    tree construction.
    
    In the CCVN composite attribute definition editor, the tree-level
    findNodeParent method can be called against a node that has not had its
    parent link applied. This was editor spotted by Llewellyn Marshall while
    investigating the reporter issue.
    
    Reporter test plan:
     1) Create a report template in the Angular full reporter in 3.13 or
        later that starts at the Circulation source and adds the Simple
        Record Extracts -> Title Proper (normalized) field for display.
     2) See that the Debug Output (Debugging Info link on the main output
        page for the report output) shows only the action.circulation and
        reporter.materialized_simple_record tables in the FROM clause.
     3) Apply this patch and rebuild the staff client.
     4) Recreate the above template with this patch in effect and see that
        the FROM clause now contains all of the correct intermediate tables.
    
    CCVM composite definition editor test plan:
     1) Attempt to add nodes to an existing CCVM composite definition, see
        that you cannot add a new boolean operator and then children
        thereto.
     2) Apply this patch and rebuild the staff client.
     3) See that the CCVM composite defition editor works correctly.
    
    Release-note: Fixes report template and CCVM composite definition editor
    regression introduced during an opimization change.

Author: Josh Stompro <stomproj@larl.org>

    LP#2069358 - Avoid a type error if grid isn't initialized.
    
    Release-Note: Fixes patron bills error that causes several settings to be skipped when Uncheck Bills setting is used.
    
    If the "Uncheck bills by default" library setting is being used (set to true), there is a function call to
    unselect all the bills that can fail if the grid isn't already initialized.  That has a side
    effect of skipping a bunch of settings checks after that statement.
    
    The other settings that are effected in some way are.
     - ui.circ.billing.amount_warn
      - ui.circ.billing.amount_limit
      - circ.staff_client.do_not_auto_attempt_print -
      - circ.disable_patron_credit - Controls Disabling "Convert change to credit option"
      - credit.processor.default - controls disabling internal CC form when there is no default, or if Stripe is the processor.
    
    Testing notes:
    
    To confirm the bug:
    1. enable the "Uncheck bills by default" library setting.
    2. Also enable disable patron credit, and/or any of the other above settings.
    3. Log out and back in to refresh settings.
    4. Open up a patron , switch to bills tab.
    5. The "Convert change to credit option" will still be shown, even though disable patron credit is enabled.
    6. Test functionality related to any of the other options listed above.
    
    After the fix is applied, the related functions should work correctly.

    LP2052742 Assure ou setting resolves before checking canSave()
    
    emitSaveChange() calls canSave(), which checks the library setting cat.require_call_number_labels.
    
    However, since the library setting check is asynchronous, there's a chance that we get to canSave()
    before we have the library setting value, so it uses the default (true) instead.
    
    This commit uses .then() to make sure that we only call emitSaveChange() after the library setting
    promise resolves and we have the actual setting value, rather than the default.
    
    Release-Note: Fixes a race condition retrieving the cat.require_call_number_labels ou setting

    LP#2087609: Fix incorrect lit_form parameter in search query
    
    Fix the issue where the \"Not Fiction\" literary form filter did not append the correct lit_form parameter due to its code being zero, which Angular was interpreting as false. This patch ensures the filter now correctly includes lit_form=0 in the query string.
    
    - The fix was mistakenly applied to the shelving location filter and has been corrected.
    - Ensure consistent behavior across all literary form filters by properly mapping each to its corresponding query parameter.
    
    Release-Note: Ensure all literary form filters append correct lit_form parameter in queries.

    As reported by Blake Graham-Henderson in IRC,
    http://irc.evergreen-ils.org/evergreen/2024-11-15#i_566219, the Dojo
    download no longer works well with http, so this commit switches to
    https as suggested by Chris Sharp.

    LP#2087609: Improve filter update handling in search form
    
    The problem was that the code for the Not fiction literary form was
    zero which Angular automatically converts to false. This caused the
    filter to be removed from the search query.
    
    Refactor filter update logic for the catalog search form.
    - Replace ngModel binding with new `updateFilters` function for each filter.
    - Ensure selected filter values are properly captured and assigned.
    - Simplify logic by directly handling HTML select elements.
    
    Release-Note: Refactor filter handling in search controls for more consistent performance.

    LP1983500 Update AngularJS login path for staff
    
    Changes the AngularJS login routing to go directly to /eg2/staff/splash
    (unless some other route was requested) rather than attempting to use
    the old AngularJS base path first. Speeds up logging in and prevents a
    flash of blank white screen in between frameworks.
    
    Release-note: Redirect to Angular staff portal from AngularJS login

    LP#2078506: Fix Background Imports to new named queues
    
    The new Background Import Manager script responsible for processing
    background import requests got out of sync with the front end user
    input, and has a defect stopping it from properly creating named import
    queues for bib records. Importing to existing queues, and ACQ imports
    (which deal with queues differently than pure Vandelay imports), are
    not impacted.
    
    To test:
    
     1) attempt to process a normal (non-ACQ) background import request
        involving a new queue (that is, one that does not already exist,
        and for which you have supplied a name)
     2) see that the background import request fails to be processed by
        the background_import_mgr.pl script, either via cron or when run
        by directly on the server, and the request remains in the "new"
        state
     3) apply this commit
     4) see that the background import request is processed correctly
    
    Release-note: Fix vandelay background importer perl script
