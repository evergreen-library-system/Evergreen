    LP#1944765: enable the Apache module mod_headers
    
    This patch enables mod_headers for Debian Stretch and Buster
    and Ubuntu Bionic and Focal during installation. Without
    mod_headers, the Angular staff client application can have
    its index page cached for 24 hours on a stock system, meaning
    that browsers will not consistently fetch the updated app
    after an upgrade.
    
    This patch does not change the Fedora Makefile as mod_headers
    is enabled by default on RHEL-like distributions.
    
    UPGRADE NOTES
    -------------
    Existing Evergreen systems on Debian and Ubuntu should
    do the following to ensure that mod_headers is active:
    
    sudo a2enmod headers
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Perform a fresh installation of Evergreen on Stretch, Buster,
        Bionic, or Focal.
    [2] Verify that mod_headers is enabled.
    [3] (Optional) Fetch the Angular staff client index page, e.g.,
        /eg2/staff, and verify that the response headers call for
        not caching it.

    Lp 1899974: Export PERL5LIB in oils_ctl.sh
    
    A change in Perl release 5.26.0 necessitates that the SIP_DIR variable
    (default value "/opt/SIPServer") be exported to the environment in
    oils_ctl.sh when attempting to start SIPServer.  This change affects
    Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) and Debian 10 (Buster) and any future
    releases.
    
    To verify the bug:
    
    1. Install OpenSRF, Evergreen, and SIPServer on an affected O/S.
    2. Start OpenSRF service.
    3. Start SIPServer via oils_ctl.sh:
       oils_ctl.sh -a start_sip
    4. Notice the "Starting OILS SIP Server" message is printed with no
       indication of failure.
    5. Verify that the PID file exists: /openils/var/run/oils_sip.pid
    6. Verify that no SIPServer processes are actually running:
       pgrep -af SIPServer
       The above should produce no output.
    
    To test this patch:
    
    1. Apply this patch and install oils_ctl.sh to /openils/bin/.
    2. Assuming you have run the previous steps, delete the PID file:
       rm /openils/var/run/oils_sip.pid
    3. Start SIPServer via oils_ctl.sh:
       oils_ctl.sh -a start_sip
    4. Notice the "Starting OILS SIP Server" message is printed.
    5. Verify that the PID file exists: /openils/var/run/oils_sip.pid
    6. `pgrep -af SIPServer` should produce output.
    
    It is safe to apply this patch on an unaffected O/S.  Explicitly
    adding SIP_DIR to PERL5LIB will have no detrimental effect on any O/S
    currently supported by Evergreen.

    LP#1844121: prevent staff login by expired barcode
    
    open-ils.auth.authenticate.init accepts an identifier as its
    sole parameter, then determines whether it looks like a
    username or barcode and retrieves the patron's password
    salt as the seed accordingly.
    
    open-ils.auth.authenticate.complete can accept the identifier
    via the 'identifier', 'username', or 'barcode' keys, but the
    key used does not need to match how .init found the patron.
    
    As a consequence, the .init/.complete dance can retrieve the
    patron by barcode but handle the barcode value as if it were
    a username, thereby bypassing the check of whether the barcode
    was inactive. In particular, the AngularJS staff client login
    process does this, meaning that staff members can log in to the
    staff client via the AngularJS form using an expired barcode.
    
    This is not good. The OPAC explicitly blocks logging in using an
    inactive barcode because it checks the identifier type and sets
    the key passed to .complete accordingly. The Angular staff login
    page also prevents logging in using an inactive barcode because
    (a) it uses open-ils.auth.login, which doesn't have the same
    problem and (b) it forces the identifier to be marked as a user
    name regardless.
    
    NOTE: this means that the Angular staff login form prevents staff
    from logging in via barcode, which potentially is a regression as
    compared to the AngularJS side (or, alternatively, is providing
    additional necessary strictness).
    
    This patch avoids the problem by having .complete inspect the
    cached seed created by .init to determine how the user was ultimately
    found.
    
    Some alternative approaches that were rejected include:
    
    [1] Having AngularJS just mirror Angular. Problem: if some staff
        users are used to using their barcode to log in, doing
        this would cause an immediate problem. I note that because
        the staff interface URL is commonly expressed as
        https://library.example/eg/staff, is currently far more common
        for the staff interface to be logged into via the AngularJS
        form rather than the Angular one.
    [2] Having AngularJS use open-ils.auth.login, but make it and
        Angular use 'identifier' as the key rather than 'username'.
        Problem: while this would have the desired effect if you
        only use native authentication, if you're using open-ils.auth_proxy,
        it won't work - open-ils.auth_proxy.login doesn't recognize an
        'identifier' parameter. While that could be changed, it
        is more invasive.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Set up a staff user that has a username, an active barcode,
        and an inactive barcode.
    [2] Log in to the AngularJS staff interface (/eg/staff) using
        the username, the active barcode, and the inactive one.
    [3] Note that you are permitted to log in with all three identifiers.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat step 2.
    [5] This time, logging in using the inactive barcode should
        fail.
    [6] Verify that other login types continue to work as expected:
        - Angular staff login form
        - OPAC
        - SIP2 terminal login
        - SIP2 user authentication
        - operator change (Angular and AngularJS)
        - Web-based self-check
    [7] Extra credit: test logging in via open-ils.auth_proxy with
        it falling back to native authentication.

    LP1866667 - Clear current_copy when pickup_lib is changed and waiting for capture
    
    When a user changes the pickup lib and a retarget is triggered
    the currently targeted copy gets excluded if there are other
    available copies.
    
    This can cause delays and confusion since the new copy may
    not be the best choice.
    
    This change clears the current_copy before the retarget in that
    situation.
    
    Testing setup.
    
    Find/create a title with items that looks like:
    
    System X ->
       Branch A -> Holdable item
       Branch B ->
    System Y
       Branch C -> Holdable item
       Branch D -> Holdable item
    
    Place a hold with a pickup location of Branch B, which should target
    the closest item at Branch A
    
    Then change the pickup location of your hold to Branch A.
    
    The retarget that happens, should switch the targeted copy to Branch C or D.
    
    After Change Applied:
    
    The hold should remain targeted to Branch A after pickup lib is changed
    to Branch A.

    LP#1821804 - Cloned patron address set to pending
    
    When cloning a patron record, the address gets set to pending and cannot
    be fixed until the new patron record is saved.
    
    The address creation steps for cloned records are a little different if
    the library setting "Patron Registration: Cloned patrons get address copy" is
    set, so test with that enabled and disabled.  In our system we have that setting
    enabled.
    
    The issue is that the values come in as a string like 't' or 'f' and need to be converted
    to a boolean value.  That is done in the normal address loading code, but wasn't in
    the cloning code.
    
    I also added in a fix for the city limits flag not getting cloned which seems
    like an related issue.  This seems like it was just cosmetic, the city limits
    does get set when the record is saved, based on the parent records address.
    
    Testing Plan:
    
    Before change:
    
    1. Enable "Cloned patrons get address copy" setting.
    2. Open up a patron record that has a valid non pending address with city limits checked.
    3. Save and Clone
    4. Notice that the address in the new cloned record says pending.
    5. Notice that the city limits checkbox isn't checked.
    
    After change applied:
    
    1. Enable "Cloned patrons get address copy" setting.
    2. Open up a patron record that has a valid non pending address with city limits checked.
    3. Save and Clone
    4. Notice that the address in the new cloned record doesn't say pending.
    5. Notice that the city limits checkbox is checked.

        Hook: penalty.PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES

        Validator: NOOP_TRUE
        Max Event Validity Delay: 1 day
        Template: test message
    
    with environment:
    
        Field Path: usr
        Label: user
    
        Field Path: usr.home_ou
        Label: context_org
    
    with event params:
    
        Parameter Name: standing_penalty
        Parameter Value: ALERT_NOTE
    
    Then bill a test patron for $100 and run something like:
    
    /openils/bin/action_trigger_runner.pl --osrf-config /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml --run-pending
    
    Without the patch, you'll get something like this in osrfsys.log:
    
    ApplyPatronPenalty: missing parameters
    
    And no ALERT_NOTE penalty.  With the patch you should see a "test message" alert note
    when reloading the patron.

    LP#1823983: repeat_delay check removes event definition id filter
    
    This bug has existed since the repeat_delay feature was added, but likely only
    rarely was triggered because most events don't have a repeat_delay, and those
    that do don't interact with the same target.  However, as more repeatable event
    definitions are created, inappropriate interaction becomes more likely.
    
    In this commit we avoid overwriting the whole join condition clause, which
    already contains an event definition id filter and needs to retain it.
    
    Included is an unrelated change that uses the new-ish form of
    interval_to_seconds that avoids DST boundary shifting issues by passing a
    context DateTime object as the second parameter.

    LP1809157 SMS Carriers display not in alphabetical order
    
    This alphabetizes the carrier display when editing the sms carrier in an existing hold.
    
    It also adds the region to the name to make the interface consistent with other interfaces.
    
    To Test:
    
    1. Enable SMS options in the Library Settings.
    2. Place a hold for a patron.
    3. Use the Edit Notifications Settings.  Enter an SMS number, if needed.
    4. Drop-down the Carrier list - the list is not in alphabetical order.
    5. Apply the patch and repeat 3-4.

    LP#1931162: DYM needs some situational optimization
    
    For some data sets and some queries the Did You Mean search suggestion
    logic can be much too slow. This is mainly in cases where a "misspelled"
    word of sufficient length greater than the symspell prefix length is
    checked against many short prefixes that have many long suggestions
    attached to them.
    
    This commit optimizes for that case in particular by testing the length
    of suggestions and prefix keys against the user input to avoid
    unnecessary tests.  Futher, it captures the edit distance of suggestions
    that pass that test in-line, avoiding expensive retesting, and caches
    the short-cutoff edit distance when in low-verbosity mode to avoid
    future different-but-not-too-different suggestions coming from the same
    prefix key.
    
    It additionally provides a general optimization by batching the capture
    of suggest counts to avoid per-suggestion secondary lookups, and a
    micro-optimization of ordering suggestions by length at distance cache
    time.

    lp1908439 Auto-override enhancment
    
    This reworks the override action dialogs in the patron display for Check
    Out and Items Out, and in the Circulation -> Renew Items interface.  It
    exposes the auto-override behavior as checkboxes giving staff more fine
    grained control over which events are auto-forced or skipped upon
    subsequent encounters.  It also changes the Cancel action for batch
    renewals to abort the remaining renewals in the batch, and makes it so
    that new authorization credentials provided during such a batch will be
    treated as an operator change for the entire batch.  We also fix an
    existing bug where events marked as already encountered for
    auto-override could leak into other patron contexts via Patron Search.

    LP1906058: Course-term map interface only allow reasonable mappings
    
    Different libraries will use different sets of course terms.  In an
    academic library context, for example, a consortium may include
    libraries with very different start and end dates to their terms/semesters,
    different numbers of terms/year, etc.
    
    This commit changes the interface to only allow users to associate
    a course with a term from the same library or one of its ancestors.
    
    To test:
    1. Create many courses and course terms and many different OUs.
    2. On the course list, click "Terms taught".  Associate some courses
    and course terms.  Make sure that you aren't able to associate your
    course with any course terms that would not be reasonable for the
    course's library.
    3. Edit a course, and choose the Course terms tab.  Continue to associate
    courses and terms, and make sure the mappings are reasonable.

    LP#1917396 - Staff Curbside Scheduling UTC Issues
    
    When a staff person tries to schedule curbside appointments
    after their UTC equivalent time moves to the next day, the
    timeslots for the next day are shown, and appointments get
    made for the next day.
    
    For example, when CST is the local timezone (UTC-6), after 6pm
    appointments for the current day are scheduled for the next day.
    Appointments for the next day get scheduled for the day after.
    
    This happens because toISOString is used to grab the current date,
    but toISOString always returns UTC time.  The date widget will show
    the correct date, but the time slots will actually be for the next
    day.  This is more noticeable if days have different schedules.
    
    Another clue is that the time slot selector will show all timeslots for
    the day, not just the ones that are upcoming.
    
    Testing Plan:
    
    1. Enable curbside for test location, and set org unit hours to
       be at least through 8pm for open hours.
    
    2. Wait until after 4PM (Pacific), 6pm CST, 7PM EST, or
       change your computer clock.
    
    3. Try to schedule an appointment for the current day.
    
    4. The appointment should get scheduled for the next day.
    
    5. Apply the fix.
    
    6. Try to schedule another appointment and see that the correct
       date gets selected.

    LP#1450519: remove unauthorized access to library setting history
    
    This patch changes the current Library Settings editor so that
    it doesn't display the setting history for a setting that the user
    doesn't have the underlying view permission for. It also removes
    the coustl IDL class [config.org_unit_setting_type_log] from PCRUD.
    
    Access to the setting history is now done through a new method,
    open-ils.actor.org_unit.settings.history.visible.retrieve, which
    accepts an authtoken and a setting name. If the user has the
    relevant view permission, setting history entries at all of the
    OUs that they have the permission at are returned. If the user
    lacks the permission, an empty array is returned. If the setting
    has no permission associated with it, all history entries for
    the setting are returned. The user must have at least STAFF_LOGIN
    to retrieve any entries at all.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] As an administrator, make some changes to the values of
        a privileged library setting (such as one of the credit card
        ones) and an unprivileged one (e.g., lib.info_url).
    [2] Log in as a staff user without administration privileges
        and go to the library settings editor. Note that while the
        current value of privileged settings are not displayed, clicking
        on the history link displays the full history of the setting.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 2.
    [4] This time, history for the privileged setting is not displayed,
        while history for an unprivileged setting continues to be
        available.

    LP#1931167: Missing YAOUS for DYM
    
    The baseline schema did not get updated to include the
    opac.did_you_mean.max_suggestions YAOUS, so fresh, rather than upgraded,
    Evergreen installs will be missing it.
    
    This commit adds it to the baseline and provides an upgrade script to
    give the setting to impacted instances.

    Lp 1936662: Add CPAN Module Prerequisites for Debian and Ubuntu
    
    This commit adds the missing CPAN module prerequisites for the "did
    you mean" feature to the PostgreSQL server Makefile targets for Debian
    Jessie, Stretch, Buster and Ubuntu Bionic.
    
    They were added to the Makefile target for Ubuntu Focal but were
    apparently overlooked in the other distros.

    LP#1815968 - Self Check Audio Alerts
    
    The method of playing audio alerts seems to not be working in modern browsers.
    
    It seemed to work in firefox V40, but no longer in V68.
    
    Adding the autoplay element and then immediately removing it prevents the audio
    from playing.  I've also noticed in the past that the audio had been cut off
    before the file was fully played.
    
    Using the .play() method does seem to work in newer versions of Firefox
    and Chrome.  Tested with Chrome V90 and Firefox V78.10.1esr.
    
    Testing Plan:
    
    1. Enable Self Check Audio Alerts Library Setting.
    2. See the docs for setting up the default audio alerts.
    https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.1/command_line_admin/_self_check_interface.html
    3. Launch self check interface, create a workstation and try to trigger an alert.
    https://eg-server.you.com/eg/circ/selfcheck/main
    4. entering a fake barcode will trigger an alert which should not be audible.
    
    Apply the fix:
    
    1. Launch self check interface, and reload/clear cache.
    2. Enter a fake barcode to trigger an audio alert.
    3. The audio alert should now be audible.

    To test:
    
    1) Without using private browsing, open up a bibliographic record in
    the Angular catalog MARC editor.
    2) Notice that there is a gap between the ELvl and Audn fixed fields.
    3) Apply this patch.
    4) Open up the same bibliographic record, this time using private
       browsing (since the Angular MARC editor caches fixed field values).
    5) Notice that the Srce fixed field is available between the ELvl and
       Audn fixed fields.
    6) Notice that you can right click inside the fixed field to get a list
       of three possible values.
    7) Repeat the test with different record types (e.g. BKS, SCO, VIS)

    LP1913221: Don't display blank course section number in OPAC
    
    To test:
    
    1) Use the Library Settings Editor to turn on the Course Materials
       Module.
    2) In Local administration, go to the course reserves list.
    3) Add several courses, some with section numbers, others without.
    4) In the OPAC, use the Course Search function to search for the courses
       you just added.
    5) Notice that the search results page has a place for section numbers,
       whether or not the course has one.
    6) Click into some of the courses.  Notice that the course page also
       includes a place for section numbers, whether or not the course has
       one.
    7) Apply this patch.
    8) Repeat steps 4-6.  Notice that the blank "section number" areas no
       longer appear.

    LP1928005 Bootstrap Opac: Current charges not aligned on mobile.
    
    This patch removes the classes from the charges table that presents the table in a vertical format.
    It wraps the table in a <div> that uses the table-responsive class.
    
    To test add some charges to a patron record.
    Bring that patron's account up in the opac and view the charges table in the smallest browser size
    possible.
    Notice that the table switches to a vertical format and the column names are mis-aligned.
    
    Apply the patch.
    
    View the table again.  The table should now be horizontal with all of the columns correct.

    During testing, 500ms was enough to avoid excessive
    PCRUD calls while still keeping the interface's display
    of duplicate or missing barcode warnings responsive.

    LP#1929136: delay barcode lookup on change in holdings editor
    
    In the Holdings Editor, any change to the barcode field results in an
    immediate API call.  Thus, if you type the barcode "123456789", you
    would get 9 separate calls: 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345 ...
    
    This commit adds a 1000ms delay to avoid excessive pcrud calls when
    typing a barcode.
