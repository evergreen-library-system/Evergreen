    Revert "LP#1851884: eg-fm-record-editor: avoid fetching all rows from linked table"
    
    This reverts commit f2824b8457fa1e941053cdc7fa715ab21e6f58c9.
    
    It causes the following error when building Angular:
    
        ERROR in src/app/share/fm-editor/fm-editor.component.ts:517:30 - error TS2339: Property 'linkedSearchConditions' does not exist on type 'FmFieldOptions'.

        518                 field.idlBaseQuery = fieldOptions.linkedSearchConditions;
    
    There does not appear to be any way to resolve this as the patch also
    relies on other changes in rel_3_8 and rel_3_9 that are not present in
    rel_3_7.  For these reasons, I am reverting the patch from rel_3_7.

    LP#1851884: eg-fm-record-editor: avoid fetching all rows from linked table
    
    This patch ensures that Angular FM record editor dialogs do
    not attempt to fetch all rows from target table when constructing
    a combobox for a linked field.
    
    In particular, it makes the following changes:
    
    * If a custom template for a field is supplied, use that by
      default rather than _also_ creating a data source for
      a combobox.
    * Rather than creating its own data source for a linked field,
      the FM record editor now uses the IDL mode of eg-combobox. By doing
      this, we use eg-combobox's default data source, which limits
      record retrievals to 100 rows max. Also, empty-click is now
      enabled by default.
    * When attempting to identify a selector for an IDL class, if
      the class doesn't define a selector and doesn't have a field named
      'name', but its primary key is a text field, use the primary
      key as the selector.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create a few thousand empty bib record buckets in your test database.
    [2] Edit a carousel under Local Administration; note that it can
        take some time for the dialog to load.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 2. This time, the carousel edit modal
        should open instantly.
    [4] Test various Angular record editor modals to confirm that they behave
        as expected. For example:
    
        * The allocate to fund dialog in Fund Administration, in particular
          to verify that only active funds show up.
        * The assign user to course modal, to verify that searching is done
          by course number, not name.
        * Filter Dialog Set editor under /eg2/en-US/staff/admin/local/config/filter_dialog_filter_set
          to verify that the drop down for the creator doesn't fetch
          all patrons. (Note that this is an artificial example).

    LP#1930617: reduce parallel requests initiated by AngularJS holdings editor
    
    This patch decreases the number of parallel requests spawned by the
    AngularJS holdings editor. This can reduce load on open-ils.pcrud when
    the editor is used to handle a large number of items in one batch.
    
    This patch takes the following approaches:
    
    - the fetching of call number affixes now only makes one request
      per relevant org unit
    - item alerts are now retrieved via fleshing when the batch of items
      is requested (as opposed to doing a PCRUD request for each copy)
    - fetching monograph parts is now done serially
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Create a bucket with a few hundred items and edit all of them
        in the AngularJS holdings editor (which is what you get when
        you edit items from the bucket interface).
    [3] Verify that the editing loads itself without causing errors
        or PCRUD drone spikes.
    [4] Verify that item alerts and monograph parts are loaded
    [5] Verify that the call number prefix and suffix drop-downs
        are correctly populated.
    [6] Verify that copy alerts can be attached to newly-created items
        and saved.

    LP#1974195: fix memory leak when performing fleshed Fieldmapper search
    
    This patch fixes a memory leak that occurs when performing
    a fleshed search of an IDL class via open-ils.cstore, open-ils.pcrud,
    or open-ils.rstore. It removes a debug-level log entry that didn't
    free a temporary string.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Perform a PCRUD search that includes fleshing and retrieves
        a large responses. One example is a search on bre that fleshes
        call numbers and copies and returns a few hundred bibs.
    [2] Observe that the PCRUD drone that serviced the request has
        increased its memory usage significantly.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the drone's memory
        usage should not (persistently) increase as much.
