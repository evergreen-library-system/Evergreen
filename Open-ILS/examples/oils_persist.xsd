When "virtual" applied to a whole class it means the class is not backed
by a DB table, view, or in-IDL SELECT statement, but instead is completely
ephemeral and constructed outside any database access.

When "virtual" is applied to a field it means there is no database column
on a table, view, or in-IDL SELECT statement behind the data, such as with
has_many links, values calculated by the business logic layer, or
temporary/scratch values.
